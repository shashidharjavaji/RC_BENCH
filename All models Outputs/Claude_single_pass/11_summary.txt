Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: AutoAIS correlates strongly with human ratings at the system level and is suitable as a development metric
Location: Section 5.5
Exact Quote: correlation between system AIS and AutoAIS scores is remarkably strong, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.96

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 between AutoAIS and human AIS scores
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.5
  Limitations: Correlation only demonstrated at system level, not instance level
  Exact Quote: correlation between system AIS and AutoAIS scores is remarkably strong, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.96

- Evidence Text: Instance-level correlation was much lower
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.5
  Limitations: Exact correlation values not provided for instance level
  Exact Quote: Correlation was much lower and more variable here

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Strong system-level correlation is clearly demonstrated, though instance-level limitations are acknowledged
Key Limitations: Lower instance-level correlation suggests caution needed for individual predictions

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: Retrieve-then-read (RTR) systems achieve the best performance on Attributed QA
Location: Section 5.3
Exact Quote: Best RTR achieves the highest performance (p ≪ 10−5, t = 4.55, in comparison with the best non-RTR system)

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Statistical significance test showing RTR superiority
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.3
  Limitations: None noted for statistical test
  Exact Quote: p ≪ 10−5, t = 4.55, in comparison with the best non-RTR system

- Evidence Text: RTR systems require more supervision and resources
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.3
  Limitations: Trade-off between performance and resource requirements
  Exact Quote: RTR approaches have the shortcoming that they require relatively large amounts of explicit supervision

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Clear statistical evidence of superior performance with appropriate acknowledgment of tradeoffs
Key Limitations: High resource requirements may limit practical applicability

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: methodology
Statement: Exact Match (EM) score is not a reliable metric for evaluating Attributed QA systems
Location: Section 5.3
Exact Quote: the systems which perform best on AIS do not necessarily achieve the strongest EM accuracy

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Examples of valid answers scored incorrectly by EM
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 4
  Limitations: Limited number of example categories presented
  Exact Quote: System predictions that AIS reveals as valid but that are scored as incorrect by Exact Match

- Evidence Text: Low correlation between EM and AIS scores
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.5
  Limitations: None noted for correlation measurement
  Exact Quote: Pearson correlation coefficient between the system EM and AIS scores is modest, at 0.45

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Multiple lines of evidence showing EM's limitations, including concrete examples and correlation analysis
Key Limitations: Could benefit from more comprehensive analysis of failure cases
