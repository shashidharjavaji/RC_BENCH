Claim 1:
Type: contribution
Statement: Chain-of-thought reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained LLMs by altering the decoding process without prompting
Location: introduction
Exact Quote: Our findings reveal that, intriguingly, CoT reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained LLMs by simply altering the decoding process.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: CoT paths found in alternative top-k tokens for GSM8K question example
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 2.1
  Limitations: Limited to specific example, may not generalize
  Exact Quote: If Kylar buys 16 glasses, he will pay $60... at k=9: We can calculate the price of 16 glasses by multiplying the price of one glass by 16...

- Evidence Text: Quantitative analysis showing high correlation between CoT paths and confidence
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.2
  Limitations: Limited sample size of 100 questions
  Exact Quote: among those, if we take the decoding path with the highest answer confidence among the top-10 decoding paths, 88% of them contain CoT paths

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Multiple examples and quantitative analysis demonstrate the phenomenon, though sample sizes are moderate
Key Limitations: Limited testing across different types of problems and models

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Model's confidence in final answers increases when a CoT path is present
Location: Section 2.2
Exact Quote: Interestingly, upon examining the model's logits, we found that the presence of a CoT path typically leads to a more confident decoding of the final answer

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Delta values showing higher confidence for CoT paths
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: Specific to selected examples
  Exact Quote: k = 9: We can calculate the price... Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses. (0.994)

- Evidence Text: Quantitative correlation between confidence and CoT paths
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.2
  Limitations: Limited to GSM8K dataset
  Exact Quote: 88% of them contain CoT paths. This shows an overwhelmingly high correlation between the model's answer confidence and the CoT paths

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Consistent evidence across examples and quantitative analysis
Key Limitations: Limited to specific datasets and models tested

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: performance
Statement: CoT-decoding improves model performance across different model scales and tasks
Location: Section 3.1
Exact Quote: CoT-decoding enhances reasoning across different model scales over the PaLM-2 model family

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Performance improvements on GSM8K across model scales
  Strength: strong
  Location: Figure 4
  Limitations: Limited to one model family
  Exact Quote: CoT-decoding consistently yields +10-30% absolute accuracy gains

- Evidence Text: Improvements across multiple model families
  Strength: strong
  Location: Figure 3
  Limitations: Limited number of tasks tested
  Exact Quote: across three language model families, PaLM-2, Mistral and Gemma, CoT-decoding effectively elicits model's reasoning

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Consistent improvements demonstrated across multiple models and tasks with substantial gains
Key Limitations: Limited to specific benchmark tasks and model families
