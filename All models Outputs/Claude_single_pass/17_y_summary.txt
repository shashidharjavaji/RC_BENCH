Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: Combining tabular data with text transcripts and audio recordings improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12%
Location: Abstract and Section 4
Exact Quote: combining tabular data from financial semi-structured documents with text transcripts and audio recordings not only improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12%

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: M3ANet + DocEmbedding achieves better MSE and F1 scores compared to baseline M3ANet across all time intervals
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 3
  Limitations: Limited to two specific datasets and one architecture
  Exact Quote: Adding DocEmbedding outperforms base methods across all tasks and intervals

- Evidence Text: Improvement shown across multiple baseline models on earnings calls dataset
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Table 4
  Limitations: Only volatility prediction evaluated for earnings calls
  Exact Quote: Our approach of augmenting with DocEmbeddings outperform corresponding base methods across 3,7,15-day intervals

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Consistent improvements shown across multiple models and datasets with statistical significance tests
Key Limitations: Limited to specific US market datasets and time periods

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Using tabular data reduces gender bias in audio-based neural networks by over 30%
Location: Abstract and Section 4.1
Exact Quote: reduces gender bias caused due to audio-based neural networks by over 30%

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Error disparity metrics across modalities showing lower bias with tabular data
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Table 6
  Limitations: Only evaluated on M3A model, limited demographic representation
  Exact Quote: We show that tabular information can substitute audio input to reduce gender bias in multimodal financial prediction tasks

- Evidence Text: Dataset gender imbalance statistics
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: Only considers binary gender categorization
  Exact Quote: only 7% in earnings calls and 12% in M&A calls identify as females

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Clear evidence of bias reduction but limited by dataset representation
Key Limitations: Binary gender assumption, limited demographic diversity

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: methodology
Statement: Using tabular data instead of audio maintains model performance while reducing processing requirements
Location: Section 4.2
Exact Quote: Replacing audio clips with tabular data from company filings leads to a reduction of data processing time and data storage requirements by over 90% and 50%

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Performance comparison showing minimal degradation
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 5
  Limitations: Processing time measurements not detailed
  Exact Quote: substituting company filings instead of its audio counterpart inconjunction with text transcripts does not significantly deteriorate model performance

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Performance claims well supported but efficiency claims lack detailed metrics
Key Limitations: Missing detailed computational benchmarks
