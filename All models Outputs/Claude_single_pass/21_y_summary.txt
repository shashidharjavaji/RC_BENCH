Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: QRNCA outperforms baseline methods in identifying query-relevant neurons
Location: Section 5.3
Exact Quote: Our QRNCA method consistently outperforms other baselines, evidenced by its higher PCR.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Quantitative comparison showing QRNCA achieves PCR of 4.4/5.6 for domain boosting/suppressing compared to baselines â‰¤1.0
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 3
  Limitations: Limited to Llama-2-7B model only
  Exact Quote: QRNCA 4.4 5.6 41.2 36.0

- Evidence Text: Detailed performance breakdown across domains and languages
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Table A2
  Limitations: Results could be domain-specific
  Exact Quote: +77.23 +17.55 4.4 -27.65 -4.95 5.6

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Comprehensive quantitative results across multiple metrics and domains show consistent outperformance
Key Limitations: Only tested on one model architecture

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Distinct localized regions for domain-specific knowledge exist in middle layers of Llama
Location: Section 5.4
Exact Quote: The distribution of QR neurons appears sparse but with distinct regions, particularly for different domains. Notably, certain regions are visible in the middle layers (10-15), suggesting specific neuron patterns.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Visualization of geographical locations of neurons
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Figure 4
  Limitations: Visualization alone may not prove functional significance
  Exact Quote: Figure 4: Geographical heatmap of detected QR neurons for different domains and languages

- Evidence Text: Layer distribution analysis showing concentration in middle layers
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Figure 2b
  Limitations: Correlation doesn't prove causation
  Exact Quote: Regarding layer distribution, the QR neurons are predominantly located in the middle layers (15-18) and the top layers (around 30)

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Multiple visualization methods show consistent patterns, but functional significance needs more validation
Key Limitations: Lacks causal analysis of observed patterns

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: Common neurons primarily express frequently used concepts and are concentrated in the top layer
Location: Section 5.5
Exact Quote: Common neurons are concentrated in the top layer, predominantly expressing frequently used tokens.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Analysis of token predictions by common neurons
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 4
  Limitations: Limited set of examples provided
  Exact Quote: in, and, to, for, today, at, as [...] C, C, c, c, 'ced'

- Evidence Text: Visualization of common neuron distribution
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Figure A2
  Limitations: Single model analysis
  Exact Quote: The distribution of common neurons.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Token prediction analysis and distribution visualization support the claim
Key Limitations: Analysis limited to one model and subset of neurons
