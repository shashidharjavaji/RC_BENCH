Claim 1:
Type: contribution
Statement: EMBODIED AGENT INTERFACE provides a standardized interface for evaluating LLMs on embodied decision-making tasks across multiple simulators
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: We propose EMBODIED AGENT INTERFACE, to address these challenges... (1) Standardization of goal specifications... (2) Standardization of modules and interfaces... (3) Broad coverage of evaluation and fine-grained metrics

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Implementation demonstrated on two simulators (BEHAVIOR and VirtualHome) with evaluation of 18 different LLMs
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 1
  Limitations: Limited to only two simulators; may not generalize to all embodied environments
  Exact Quote: We implement EMBODIED AGENT INTERFACE on two embodied decision-making benchmarks: BEHAVIOR and VirtualHome, and evaluated 18 different LLMs.

- Evidence Text: Unified interface using LTL formulas for goal specification
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 2.2
  Limitations: LTL formalism may not capture all possible goal types
  Exact Quote: In EMBODIED AGENT INTERFACE, goals g, subgoals φ, and action sequences ā are modeled as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The framework demonstrates successful implementation across multiple simulators and LLMs, with clear standardization approaches
Key Limitations: Limited testing environments, potential constraints of LTL formalism

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Most LLMs struggle with faithful translation of natural language instructions into grounded states
Location: Section 4.1
Exact Quote: LLMs generally have difficulties distinguishing intermediate subgoals and final goals.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Example of incorrect goal prediction in VirtualHome task
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: Single example may not be representative
  Exact Quote: For example, in the VirtualHome task Drink, GPT-4o predicts some intermediate states as part of the final goal (e.g., open(freezer) and inside(water, glass)).

- Evidence Text: Quantitative performance metrics across models
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 4
  Limitations: Specific error rates not fully detailed
  Exact Quote: State Goal Precision/Recall metrics across multiple models showing varied performance

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Consistent evidence across multiple models and evaluation metrics
Key Limitations: Could benefit from more detailed error analysis

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: performance
Statement: o1-preview significantly outperforms other models, especially on the BEHAVIOR simulator
Location: Results section
Exact Quote: o1-preview significantly outperforms others, especially on the BEHAVIOR simulator (74.9% vs. 64.2%)

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Detailed performance metrics across tasks
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 3
  Limitations: Performance difference varies by task type
  Exact Quote: o1-preview achieves 81.0% task success rate in BEHAVIOR compared to next best model at 56.0%

- Evidence Text: Breakdown of performance across different modules
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: Some variability in performance across different tasks
  Exact Quote: o1-preview leads in several areas, including goal interpretation on VirtualHome and both action sequencing and transition modeling on BEHAVIOR

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Consistent superior performance across multiple metrics and tasks
Key Limitations: Performance advantage varies by specific task and metric
