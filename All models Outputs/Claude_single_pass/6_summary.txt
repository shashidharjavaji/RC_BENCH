Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: kNN-LM achieves state-of-the-art performance on WIKITEXT-103
Location: Section 4.1
Exact Quote: kNN-LM improves perplexity on WIKITEXT-103 from 18.65 (Baevski & Auli, 2019) to a new state-of-the-art of 16.12

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experimental results showing perplexity improvement
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: Limited to one dataset
  Exact Quote: Base LM (Baevski & Auli, 2019) 17.96 18.65 247M
+kNN-LM 16.06 16.12 247M

- Evidence Text: Additional improvement with continuous cache
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: None noted
  Exact Quote: +kNN-LM + Continuous Cache 15.81 15.79 247M

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Results clearly show improvement over previous SOTA with multiple configurations
Key Limitations: Limited to one benchmark dataset

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Retrieving nearest neighbors from a large corpus outperforms training on it
Location: Section 4.2
Exact Quote: retrieving nearest neighbors from the corpus outperforms training on it

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experimental comparison on WIKI-3B
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 3
  Limitations: Single dataset comparison
  Exact Quote: WIKI-3B - 16.11 15.17
WIKI-100M WIKI-3B 14.61 13.73

- Evidence Text: Performance with different datastore sizes
  Strength: strong
  Location: Figure 2
  Limitations: Limited to specific model architecture
  Exact Quote: using only 1.6B examples for the datastore already surpasses the performance of the model trained on all of WIKI-3B

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Multiple experiments with different configurations support the claim
Key Limitations: Limited to specific model architecture and dataset

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: contribution
Statement: kNN-LM enables effective domain adaptation without additional training
Location: Section 4.3
Exact Quote: Adding kNN search over BOOKS to the WIKI-3B model reduces perplexity by 14 points (to 20.47), demonstrating that kNN-LM allows a single model to be useful in multiple domains

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Domain adaptation experimental results
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 4
  Limitations: Tested only on one domain pair
  Exact Quote: WIKI-3B - 37.13 34.84
WIKI-3B BOOKS 24.85 20.47

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Shows clear improvement in domain adaptation
Key Limitations: Limited evaluation across different domain pairs
