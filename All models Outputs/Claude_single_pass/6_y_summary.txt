Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: The proposed JMRI framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark visual grounding datasets
Location: Section IV.D
Exact Quote: our JMRI, VLTVG, and SeqTR, which are all the transformer-based methods, rank in the top three in accuracy, better than the other methods

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Performance results on RefCOCO dataset showing JMRI II outperforms other methods on val and testA
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section IV.D.2
  Limitations: Performance on testB is third-best only
  Exact Quote: On the RefCOCO dataset, JMRI II outperforms all other methods on val and testA, and it obtains the third-best accuracy on testB

- Evidence Text: Results on RefCOCO+ dataset
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section IV.D.2
  Limitations: None noted
  Exact Quote: On the RefCOCO+ dataset, our larger version achieves the highest accuracy on both val and testA, and it obtains the second-best accuracy on testB

- Evidence Text: Performance on RefCOCOg dataset
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section IV.D.2
  Limitations: None noted
  Exact Quote: On the RefCOCOg dataset, our method obtains the best accuracy on both RefCOCOg-google and RefCOCOg-umd splits

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Comprehensive experimental results across multiple datasets consistently show top performance, with detailed comparisons against state-of-the-art methods
Key Limitations: Performance varies slightly across different test splits

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: The early joint representation module produces semantically meaningful feature alignments
Location: Section IV.E.1
Exact Quote: Grad-CAM maps usually pay attention to the relevant cues and highlight image regions corresponding to the target object

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Visualization analysis using Grad-CAM
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section IV.E.1
  Limitations: Qualitative evidence only; acknowledged limitation in precise localization
  Exact Quote: these results further prove that the early joint representations have strong class-discriminative ability, lacking of localization information

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Visual evidence supports semantic alignment claim but acknowledges limitations
Key Limitations: Relies mainly on qualitative visualization evidence

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: contribution
Statement: The model achieves best performance with lowest training cost by freezing pretrained CLIP
Location: Section III.A
Exact Quote: By freezing the pretrained CLIP and updating the other modules, we achieve the best performance with the least training budget and deployment cost

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Training details and computational requirements
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section IV.B.2
  Limitations: Limited direct comparison of training costs with other methods
  Exact Quote: for JMRI I/II, the whole training process consumes about 39/88 h with 66.7M/67.8M tunable parameters and 19.4G/97.1G floating point operations (FLOPs)

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: No
Robustness: low
Confidence Level: low
Justification: While training details are provided, insufficient comparative evidence of training costs versus other methods
Key Limitations: Lacks direct comparison of training efficiency with other approaches
