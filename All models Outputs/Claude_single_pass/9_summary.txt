Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: GopherCite produces high quality answers with supporting evidence on Natural Questions and ELI5 datasets
Location: Results section 3.2
Exact Quote: We find in Table 1 that humans determine our best model responses to be high-quality 80% of the time on our NaturalQuestionsFiltered validation subset... The model's responses are deemed high-quality 67% of the time on our ELI5Filtered test subset.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Quantitative results on NaturalQuestionsFiltered dataset showing 80% S&P score
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: Results are on filtered subset, not full dataset; human evaluation introduces some subjectivity
  Exact Quote: SFT – top@64 (ours) 80.0 ±6.1

- Evidence Text: Quantitative results on ELI5Filtered dataset showing 67% S&P score
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: Results are on filtered subset; human evaluation introduces subjectivity
  Exact Quote: RL – top@16 (ours) 66.9 ±7.0

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Results are supported by clear quantitative evidence with statistical confidence intervals, though on filtered datasets
Key Limitations: Results only apply to filtered subsets of datasets, not full datasets; relies on human evaluation

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: Declining to answer improves performance substantially while maintaining high coverage
Location: Results section 3.3
Exact Quote: Declining to answer some percentage of questions using the reward model results in higher Supported&Plausible human ratings on the resulting subset of attempted questions

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Performance improvement on NaturalQuestions when declining to answer
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: Trade-off between coverage and performance
  Exact Quote: More than 90% of answers are supported and plausible when attempting 70% of questions

- Evidence Text: Performance improvement on ELI5 when declining to answer
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: Trade-off between coverage and performance
  Exact Quote: More than 80% of answers are supported and plausible when attempting 70% of questions

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Clear quantitative evidence showing improved performance with selective answering while maintaining reasonable coverage
Key Limitations: Inherent trade-off between coverage and performance that must be balanced

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: performance
Statement: Model scale improves performance substantially
Location: Section 3.6
Exact Quote: Figure 7 shows that scaling the Supervised Fine-tuning generator brings clear improvements in both the Supported&Plausible scores as well as the Preference judgements. Across the board, our strongest model is the largest 280B member of the Gopher family.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Quantitative comparison across model sizes
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.6, Figure 7
  Limitations: Only tested three model sizes; could be other factors beyond scale
  Exact Quote: scaling up the generator agent's parameter count... demonstrates significant improvements

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Clear trend shown in results, but limited number of model sizes tested
Key Limitations: Only three model sizes tested; could be confounding factors
