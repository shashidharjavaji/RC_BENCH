Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: MGN achieves superior results over previous state-of-the-art methods in weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing.
Location: Conclusion section
Exact Quote: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our MGN against previous baselines.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: MGN achieves significant performance gains in segment-level and event-level predictions against baselines with contrastive learning and label refinement.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Table 1 data comparison
  Limitations: The gains of audio events are not as significant as visual modality.
  Exact Quote: MGN (w C+R) achieves 60.2 Visual, 61.9 Audio-Visual, and 55.5 Type@AV at segment-level, and 50.9 Visual, 59.7 Audio-Visual, and 49.6 Type@AV at event-level.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Quantitative data supports the superior performance of MGN overall, though with acknowledged limitations in audio event detection.
Key Limitations: Lower relative gains in audio events; limited exploration of error cases or comparison under varied conditions.

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: MGN introduces class-aware unimodal grouping and modality-aware cross-modal grouping modules to enhance audio-visual video parsing.
Location: Abstract section
Exact Quote: We introduce the class-aware unimodal grouping module to generate class-aware unimodal representations with learnable tokens by using unimodal grouping blocks for each modality.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Introducing class-aware unimodal grouping (CUG) and modality-aware cross-modal grouping (MCG) realizes significant performance gains in segment-wise predictions.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4 Limitation
  Limitations: No direct comparison of the feature learning quality compared to baselines other than through performance metrics.
  Exact Quote: Adding CUG to the vanilla baseline achieves significant gains of 2.4 Visual. Incorporating MCG with CUG highly increases Audio-Visual, Tyep@AV, Event@AV by 1.7, 1.6 and 1.8.

- Evidence Text: MGN's efficient use of parameters results in superior Type@AV and Event@AV performance, especially in audio, with only 47.2% parameters of the vanilla baseline.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Class-aware Unimodal Grouping & Modality-aware Cross-modal Grouping discussion
  Limitations: Details on how parameter efficiency translates to computational efficiency or operational benefits in real-world applications are not provided.
  Exact Quote: When depth of CUG and MCG is 3 and 6, MGN with only 47.2% parameters of vanilla baseline performs best on Type@AV and Event@AV, especially on Audio.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Strong quantitative evidence supports the methodology's effectiveness, but a deeper analysis into practical implications of parameter efficiency would strengthen the conclusion.
Key Limitations: Lack of detail on computational efficiency and real-world applicability; improvement in audio events less pronounced.
