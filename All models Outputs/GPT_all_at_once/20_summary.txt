Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Code generation models adjust outputs towards anchors, resulting in decreased functional accuracy
Location: Experimental Results Section
Exact Quote: prepending print-var anchor functions consistently lowers Codex and CodeGens’ functional accuracies across different number of prompted canonical solution lines

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Prepending print-var anchor functions lowers functional accuracy across different prompted canonical solution lines
  Strength: strong
  Location: Experimental Results Section
  Limitations: limited to specific model (Codex) and prompt configurations
  Exact Quote: prepending print-var anchor functions consistently lowers Codex and CodeGens’ functional accuracies across different number of prompted canonical solution lines 

- Evidence Text: Anchor functions influence generated solutions, with elements of anchor function often appearing in model outputs
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Experimental Results Section
  Limitations: limited evidence on how these elements affect overall solution correctness
  Exact Quote: we additionally find that elements of anchor function often appear in both models’ outputs 

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is supported by systematic experimental results showing that the inclusion of anchor functions in prompts consistently influences model outputs and functional accuracy.
Key Limitations: Experiments are model and prompt-specific, may not generalize across all types of code generation tasks.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Adding conflicting function names to prompts leads to a significant drop in Codex's functional accuracy.
Location: Attribute Substitution Section
Exact Quote: When we request a conflicting function name, Codex’s accuracy drops from 100% to only 4.4%-4.6%

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Requesting a conflicting function name in prompts reduces Codex's accuracy to 4.4%-4.6% from 100%
  Strength: strong
  Location: Attribute Substitution Section
  Limitations: Experiment conducted with Codex on specifically designed MathEquation prompts
  Exact Quote: When we request a conflicting function name, Codex’s accuracy drops from 100% to only 4.4%-4.6%

- Evidence Text: Codex frequently generates solutions based on the specified function name in the presence of a conflict
  Strength: strong
  Location: Attribute Substitution Section
  Limitations: Does not address the adaptability of the model to counteract this behavior with additional training or data
  Exact Quote: Codex responds with the function specified in the function name for between 52% and 80% of prompts

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Empirical data from experiments clearly supports the claim, with a sharp accuracy decrease indicating a significant impact of the intervention on model performance.
Key Limitations: Specificity to prompts designed to elicit this response; it's not clear if or how this might impact more general code generation tasks.
