Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: QR neurons significantly impact knowledge expression
Location: Section 5.3
Exact Quote: our identified QR neurons significantly affect the probability of correct answers while exerting a relatively low impact on unrelated queries.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: QRNCA method outperforms other baselines with a higher PCR and boosting ratio on the language dataset.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.3, Table 3
  Limitations: Comparison limited to selected baselines and datasets
  Exact Quote: Our QRNCA method consistently outperforms other baselines, evidenced by its higher PCR. This indicates that our identified QR neurons significantly affect the probability of correct answers while exerting a relatively low impact on unrelated queries.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Evidence is based on comparative analysis with baselines and demonstrates significant performance enhancement.
Key Limitations: Limited comparative analysis may not account for all possible methods or data variables.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: QRNCA identifies localized knowledge regions in LLMs
Location: Section 7
Exact Quote: this study pioneers the exploration of localized knowledge regions in LLMs and demonstrates Llama contains knowledge-specific regions in the middle layers while language-specific neurons tend to be distributed across different layers

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Visible localized regions in Llama for different domains and languages, observed through neuron distribution visualization.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 7
  Limitations: Analysis is descriptive with visualization, lacking quantitative depth.
  Exact Quote: this study pioneers the exploration of localized knowledge regions in LLMs and demonstrates Llama contains knowledge-specific regions in the middle layers while language-specific neurons tend to be distributed across different layers

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: low
Confidence Level: low
Justification: Claim supported by observed neuron distribution visualization but lacks deeper quantitative analysis.
Key Limitations: Lacks in-depth quantitative evaluation of localized knowledge regions.
