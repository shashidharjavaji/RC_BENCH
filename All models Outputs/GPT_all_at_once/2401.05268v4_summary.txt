Statement: AUTOACT achieves superior performance to various baselines in HotpotQA and ScienceQA using the Llama-70B model without relying on large-scale labeled datasets or closed-source models.
Location: Section Results
Exact Quote: the planning process and reaches a clear division-of-labor among sub-agents for group planning, resulting in an improvement than FIREACT, with ↑5.77% on HotpotQA and ↑6.67% on ScienceQA with Llama-70B model. Additionally, AUTOACT achieves self-planning without relying on closed-source models and large-scale labeled datasets

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: AUTOACT outperformed FIREACT by +5.77% on HotpotQA and +6.67% on ScienceQA, using the Llama-70B model.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section Results
  Limitations: Comparison limited to specific tasks and models.
  Exact Quote: resulting in an improvement than FIREACT, with ↑5.77% on HotpotQA and ↑6.67% on ScienceQA with Llama-70B model

- Evidence Text: Autoact's approach enables planning without reliance on large-scale labeled data and closed-source models, offering a method for automatic agent learning from scratch.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: Lacks detail on the scalability or applicability to diverse AI tasks beyond QA.
  Exact Quote: an automatic agent learning framework for QA that does not rely on large-scale annotated data and synthetic planning trajectories from closed-source models

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Supported by quantitative improvements in two distinct tasks using a prominent model, though broader applicability remains partially addressed.
Key Limitations: Experiments focus on QA tasks, may not generalize across all AI tasks.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Multi-agent architectures generally exhibit better performance than single-agent configurations.
Location: Section Results
Exact Quote: Under identical settings, multi-agent architectures generally exhibit better performance than single-agent

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Comparative performance data showing multi-agent architectures, like AUTOACT, outperform single-agent architectures across various tasks.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section Results, ablation studies
  Limitations: Direct comparisons possibly affected by tasks' intrinsic multi-agent advantage.
  Exact Quote: multi-agent architectures generally exhibit better performance than single-agent

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Evidence directly illustrates the advantages of multi-agent systems in learning efficiency and performance.
Key Limitations: Potential bias towards tasks that inherently favor multi-agent interaction.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: Excessive division-of-labor among agents can lead to suboptimal performance.
Location: Section Approach Ablations
Exact Quote: excessive differentiation (Tool-Specified) not only fails to achieve better results but can sometimes even be less effective than not differentiating (One) at all

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Data indicating that while a moderate division-of-labor benefits performance, over-specialization (-tool specified division) does not offer advantages and might even impair performance.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section Approach Ablations
  Limitations: Based on specific configurations and tasks; broader implications not fully explored.
  Exact Quote: excessive differentiation (Tool-Specified) not only fails to achieve better results but can sometimes even be less effective than not differentiating (One) at all

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Empirical evidence shows diminishing returns on increasing agent specialization, consistent with other research.
Key Limitations: Insights drawn primarily from specific task-related performance, may not generalize.
