Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: State CoT significantly enhances performance within the 'unseen' test set.
Location: section 4.5
Exact Quote: State CoT does not improve plan executability within the ‘long’ test set, yet it significantly enhances performance within the ‘unseen’ test set (e.g., 100% in row 4).

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: 100% performance enhancement in 'unseen' test set with State CoT.
  Strength: strong
  Location: section 4.5
  Limitations: Limited efficacy to short problems only.
  Exact Quote: it significantly enhances performance within the ‘unseen’ test set (e.g., 100% in row 4).

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Evidence supports the claim of performance enhancement by State CoT in unseen test sets, but its applicability is restricted to problems similar in length to the training distribution.
Key Limitations: Efficacy restricted to short problems and unseen test set scenarios matching training distribution.

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: Reinforcement learning notably improves model performance in longer test set problems.
Location: section 4.7
Exact Quote: RL notably improves the performance under our end-to-end planning paradigm, especially on longer problems.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: RL boosted the validity rate on the ‘long’ test set from 34.8% to 41.5%.
  Strength: strong
  Location: section 4.7
  Limitations: Model training involved only 10% of the ‘long’ test set and suboptimal rewards.
  Exact Quote: RL boosted the validity rate on the ‘long’ test set from 34.8% to 41.5%.

- Evidence Text: RL enabled the model to solve problems in the ‘unseen’ test set, achieving a 12.5% where it previously failed.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: section 4.7
  Limitations: Improvements due to RL could be conflated with effects of limited additional training data.
  Exact Quote: it also enabled the model to solve problems in the ‘unseen’ test set, achieving a 12.5% where it previously failed to generate any valid plans.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Clear evidence of performance improvement in longer problems and unseen test sets due to reinforcement learning, though there's mentioning of potential conflation with training data effects.
Key Limitations: Limited training data for RL; suboptimal rewards may not fully capitalize on RL's potential.

Claim 3:
Type: methodology
Statement: Permutation augmentation enhances executability rate significantly in unseen test sets.
Location: section 4.2
Exact Quote: we observe a remarkable 75.5% score in “unseen” test set.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: 75.5% executability rate in 'unseen' test set due to permutation augmentation.
  Strength: strong
  Location: section 4.2
  Limitations: Does not significantly improve the validity rate.
  Exact Quote: a remarkable 75.5% score in “unseen” test set.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Robust evidence of executability rate improvement with permutation augmentation in unseen test sets; however, its impact on validity rate is minimal.
Key Limitations: Lack of significant impact on validity rate.
