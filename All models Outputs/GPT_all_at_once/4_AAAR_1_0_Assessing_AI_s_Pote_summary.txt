Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Closed-source LLMs generally outperform open-source LLMs on AAAR-1.0, likely due to their richer scientific knowledge stemming from a larger model size.
Location: section Experiments and Analyses
Exact Quote: Closed-source LLMs generally outperform open-source LLMs on AAAR-1.0, likely due to their richer scientific knowledge stemming from a larger model size.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 1 shows various LLMs’ performances on the 1,049 instances of EQINFER task, demonstrating closed-source LLMs' superiority.
  Strength: strong
  Location: section Experiments and Analyses, EQUATIONINFERENCE table results
  Limitations: Based on performance in a specific benchmark (AAAR-1.0) that may not capture all dimensions of LLM capabilities.
  Exact Quote: Table 1: Various LLMs’ performances on the 1,049 instances of EQINFER task.

- Evidence Text: Closed-source LLMs, especially GPT-4 models, achieve significant accuracy improvements over open-source models, highlighting their advanced handling of long-context instructions and richer scientific knowledge.
  Strength: strong
  Location: section EQUATIONINFERENCE, Main results
  Limitations: Evidence derived from performance on set tasks within AAAR-1.0, which may not generalize across all research or AI domains.
  Exact Quote: closed-source LLMs generally achieve superior accuracy, probably owing to the richer scientific knowledge from the larger model parameters.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported by direct comparative performance data from the AAAR-1.0 benchmark, indicating a clear advantage of closed-source over open-source LLMs in terms of scientific knowledge representation and problem-solving abilities.
Key Limitations: The analysis is confined to the AAAR-1.0 benchmark, which, while comprehensive, may not fully represent all possible research or AI applications.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Neither extending the input modality (i.e., leveraging text and figures) nor enlarging the input context guarantees enhanced performance for LLMs.
Location: section Experiments and Analyses
Exact Quote: Neither extending the input modality (i.e., leveraging text and figures) nor enlarging the input context guarantees enhanced performance.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Investigation into the impact of input context lengths on LLM performance shows that beyond a certain threshold, additional context does not contribute to, and may even reduce, model performance.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: section EQUATIONINFERENCE, Main results
  Limitations: Findings are specific to the tasks and LLMs tested within AAAR-1.0, and may not extrapolate to other models or input types not covered by the benchmark.
  Exact Quote: increasing the input context doesn’t help the performance and even significantly drops Qwen’s scores.

- Evidence Text: The inclusion of image information fails to significantly boost performance, implying limitations in current LLMs’ ability to process and reason with multimodal inputs effectively.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: section PAPERWEAKNESS, Q2: does multi-modal input boost performance?
  Limitations: The observed lack of significant impact of multimodal inputs might be task-specific or indicative of current technological limitations in integrating textual and visual data.
  Exact Quote: Overall, image information, including both figures and tables, doesn’t bring significant performance improvement.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Supported by empirical evidence from specific LLM performance assessments, the claim delineates current strengths and boundaries of LLM capabilities in relation to input modality and context.
Key Limitations: Evidence might not cover all existing and future LLM architectures, especially as models continue to evolve towards better integration of multimodal information.
