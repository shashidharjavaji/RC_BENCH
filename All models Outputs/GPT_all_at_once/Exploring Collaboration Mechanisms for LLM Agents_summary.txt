Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Starting or dominating multi-agent collaboration with debate yields relatively optimal outcomes.
Location: Key Takeaways/Strategy Selection
Exact Quote: Starting or dominating multi-agent collaboration with debate, yields relatively optimal outcomes, as seen from Table 2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Debate-initial and debate-dominant strategies exhibit superiority in performance across datasets and societal configurations.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Phenomena of Conformity and Consensus Reaching
  Limitations: Limited by the explored collaboration strategies and societal configurations.
  Exact Quote: For instance, on MMLU dataset, debate-dominant collaborative strategies, like p0p0p1, p0p1p0, and p1p0p0, all containing two rounds of debate, display a pronounced outperformance.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Supported by quantitative data and consistent across different tasks and settings.
Key Limitations: Experiments limited to specific collaborative strategies and LLM agents.

Claim 2:
Type: contribution
Statement: LLM agents manifest behaviors reminiscent of human social tendencies, such as conformity and the principle of majority rule in group thinking.
Location: Conclusion and Future Work
Exact Quote: LLM agents manifest behaviors reminiscent of human social tendencies, such as conformity or the principle of majority rule in group thinking.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Collaboration leads to conformity, beneficial or harmful in performance, supported by analysis on answer correctness change.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Further Analysis on Machine Social Collaboration
  Limitations: Analysis may not fully capture the dynamics of group decision-making.
  Exact Quote: Collaboration is generally effective in the group, especially for tackling difficult tasks, as observed from Figure 13, 24, 33, 42, 56; and Figure 21, 30, 39, 53, 67.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Empirical findings underscore LLM agents' human-like social behaviors in collaborative settings.
Key Limitations: Observations based on specific tasks and may not generalize across all forms of collaboration.
