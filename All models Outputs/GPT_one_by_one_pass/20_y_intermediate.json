This method, based on log probability increase and inner product calculations, outperforms seven other static methods in identifying crucial neurons for final predictions, providing valuable insights into how knowledge is stored and processed in both the attention and feed-forward network (FFN) layers of LLMs.",

The successful application of this method to analyze six types of knowledge across attention and FFN layers, coupled with its benchmark against seven other static methods using metrics like Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), probability, and log probability of correct token predictions, provides a robust foundation for their claims.",

The authors' approach systematically addresses the challenges of neuron-level attribution in LLMs, showing significant improvement over existing methods. However, the reliance on static methods and the focus on two model architectures (GPT2-large and Llama-7B) may limit the generalizability of the findings.",

They systematically demonstrate the effectiveness of their methods in identifying significant 'value neurons' and 'query neurons' across different layers and heads of GPT2 and Llama models. However, they also recognize the inherent limitations of their focus and the potential for expanding this methodology to other knowledge types and comparison methodologies.",

The experiments demonstrate notable decreases in MRR and probability metrics when intervening on attributed neurons, underscoring the potential effectiveness of static methods in knowledge attribution. However, the acknowledgment of limiting the study to six types of knowledge and specific LLM models points to an area for future research expansion, affecting the robustness of the conclusions.",

While these constraints are acknowledged by the authors, they also suggest areas for future work, such as incorporating dynamic methods and expanding the scope of knowledge types analyzed.",

Although the methods for neuron-level knowledge attribution and the analysis of knowledge storage demonstrate robustness in the models tested, extending these findings to other models without further validation introduces uncertainty.",

This dual perspective demonstrates an understanding of the method's impact, grounded in the evidential support from their methodological approach to identifying and editing pivotal neurons.",

This theoretical nature of evidence, highlighted by practical applicability considerations, underscores both the strength and the limitation of the method's robustness.",
