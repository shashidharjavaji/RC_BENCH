Experimental setup included selecting 300 neurons based on their GPT-4 score and constructing test sentences to probe for Type I and II errors. This rigorous evaluation using GPT-4 generated explanations of GPT-2 XL neurons revealed that even among top-rated explanations, the faithfulness was low, with low F1 scores indicating high error rates in the observational mode, and no evidence of causal efficacy found in the intervention mode.",
