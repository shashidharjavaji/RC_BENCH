Furthermore, the RAG-based GPT model, assisted by the top five retrieved paragraphs, exhibits improved accuracy in identifying IPCC sections related to wetland restoration (e.g., IPCC WGIII Section 7.4). However, it still tends to excessively condense content and generate hallucinations, similar to the zero-shot GPT model... This decreases the quality of the generated statements... However, there is insufficient evidence to justify summarizing these specific details into the broader statement provided by the model... It encourages us to explore the integration of multi-dimensional features for linking statements in future work, beyond mere semantic similarity or key term matching."
