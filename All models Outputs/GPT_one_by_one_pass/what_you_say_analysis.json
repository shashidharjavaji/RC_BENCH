This approach outperforms traditional methods that use either unimodal features or simpler fusion techniques. Specifically, the model showcases significant improvement in prediction error rates across various forecasting windows, leverages both text and audio data to mitigate overfitting issues seen in audio-only models, and demonstrates the importance of multimodal features in capturing market reactions more accurately.",

The use of a unique dataset, careful feature extraction, and the implementation of advanced model architectures like BiLSTM for capturing inter-modal dependencies, contribute to the strength and reliability of the findings. The significance of multimodal integration is empirically confirmed through comparative performance metrics and statistical significance testing.",

Additionally, the method's dependency on accurate audio-text alignment underscores the need for precise preprocessing, which could be challenging in less controlled settings.",
