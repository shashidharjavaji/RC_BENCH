Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Combining tabular data from financial semi-structured documents with text transcripts and audio recordings improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12%.
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: We show that combining tabular data from financial semi-structured documents with text transcripts and audio recordings not only improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12% but also reduces gender bias caused due to audio-based neural networks by over 30%.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Results from experiments show an 8-12% relative improvement in stock volatility and price movement prediction across several baseline and state-of-the-art models.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: None mentioned.
  Exact Quote: We utilize tabular information from financial semi-structured documents with existing textual and audio modalities to show 8-12% relative improvement in stock volatility and price movement prediction tasks across several baseline and state-of-the-art models.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Evidence supports the claim with specific experimental results.
Key Limitations: None mentioned in the provided text.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Supplementing existing conference calls transcripts with the tabular data substantially reduces the unintended gender bias in financial prediction tasks.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: We demonstrate that supplementing existing conference calls transcripts with the tabular data substantially reduces the unintended gender bias in financial prediction tasks and offers a robust and unbiased alternative to gender-sensitive audio features in cases where under-representation of women speakers (only 7% female speakers in SP 500 Earnings calls dataset (Li et al., 2020) and 12% in Merger&Acquisition calls (Sawhney et al., 2021b) dataset) in executive positions induces unneeded correlations in model predictions.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The use of tabular data extracted from semi-structured financial documents reduces gender bias by 30% in audio-based neural networks, without significant performance degradation.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: None mentioned.
  Exact Quote: We empirically show the extent of induced gender bias due to audio modality in the financial prediction models and demonstrate the usefulness of tabular data extracted from semi-structured financial documents as an alternative to audio modality for reducing gender bias by 30% in audio-based neural networks, without significant performance degradation.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Evidence supports the claim with specific experimental results but more details on the experiments and methodology would strengthen the conclusion.
Key Limitations: None mentioned in the provided text.
