Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: The proposed visual grounding framework, JMRI, combines early joint representation and deep cross-modal interaction for improved performance.
Location: II. RELATED WORK
Exact Quote: We propose a novel and effective visual grounding framework by combining early joint representation and deep cross-modal interaction.

Evidence:
Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is supported by the description of the proposed JMRI framework, which involves both early joint representation and deep cross-modal interaction.
Key Limitations: The effectiveness of the JMRI framework has not yet been demonstrated through experimental results.

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: The use of the CLIP image-text foundation model enables the extraction and alignment of visual and linguistic features, ensuring that the resulting features are semantically aligned.
Location: II. RELATED WORK
Exact Quote: We propose to use CLIP to extract and align visual and linguistic features, ensuring that the resulting features are semantically aligned.

Evidence:
Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is supported by the description of the JMRI framework, which utilizes the CLIP model for feature extraction and alignment.
Key Limitations: The effectiveness of using CLIP for this purpose has not yet been experimentally validated.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: performance
Statement: By freezing the pretrained CLIP model and updating only the other modules, the proposed framework achieves the best performance with the lowest training cost and deployment cost.
Location: II. RELATED WORK
Exact Quote: By freezing the pretrained CLIP and updating the other modules, we achieve the best performance with the least training budget and deployment cost.

Evidence:
Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: No
Robustness: low
Confidence Level: low
Justification: The claim that the proposed framework achieves the best performance with the lowest training and deployment costs is not supported by experimental results in this section.
Key Limitations: The claim lacks experimental validation and comparison with alternative approaches.
