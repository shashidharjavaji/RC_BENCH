Claim 5:
Type: methodology
Statement: LLMs may favor the answers generated by themselves.
Location: 3.3 Limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge
Exact Quote: We adopt the term “self-enhancement bias” from social cognition literature [4] to describe the effect that LLM judges may favor the answers generated by themselves.

Evidence:
Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: No
Robustness: low

Claim 6:
Type: methodology
Statement: LLMs have limited capability in grading math and reasoning questions.
Location: 3.3 Limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge
Exact Quote: LLMs are known to have limited math and reasoning capability [10], which results in its failure of grading such questions because they do not know the correct answers.

Evidence:
Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: No
Robustness: low
Confidence Level: low
Justification: This claim is not supported by evidence in the provided text.
Key Limitations: No experimental results or data are provided to support this claim.
