Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: The modified problems significantly degrade the performance when using implicit reasoning, while the performance of explicit reasoning is always perfect.
Location: 2.1
Exact Quote: From the results in Table 1, we can clearly see\nthat, compare to the original problems, the modified problems significantly degrade the performance when using implicit reasoning. While the\nperformance of explicit reasoning is always perfect.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: In Table 1, the accuracy of implicit reasoning on modified problems is significantly lower than that on original problems, while the accuracy of explicit reasoning on modified problems is always 100%.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: The results are based on a specific set of modified problems and may not generalize to other types of problems.
  Exact Quote: Table 1\n|Col1|3-step 5-step|3-step 5-step|\n|---|---|---|\n\n|original reverse divide|85.01 53.95 70.62 13.71 69.86 37.28|100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00|

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence from Table 1 strongly supports the claim.
Key Limitations: The results may not generalize to other types of problems.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Implicit reasoning does not follow a step-by-step process but just intuitively thinks of the answer, which makes it less reliable.
Location: 3
Exact Quote: This finding remind us that there\nis no free lunch, that is, under current technological conditions, there may not be a perfect solution\nthat can make LLMs output very few tokens while\nkeeping the accuracy on solving complex problems.\nWhen you ask LLMs to give the answer directly,\nyou should know that it has not actually undergone\na real reasoning. Scaling the test-time by using explicit CoT may still be the most feasible method to\nfurther propel the capabilities of LLMs at present.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The performance of implicit reasoning degrades significantly when the problems are modified to require a step-by-step reasoning process.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: 2.1
  Limitations: The evidence is based on a specific set of modified problems and may not generalize to other types of problems.
  Exact Quote: From the results in Table 1, we can clearly see\nthat, compare to the original problems, the modified problems significantly degrade the performance when using implicit reasoning. While the\nperformance of explicit reasoning is always perfect.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence supports the claim, but it is based on a limited set of problems.
Key Limitations: The results may not generalize to other types of problems.
