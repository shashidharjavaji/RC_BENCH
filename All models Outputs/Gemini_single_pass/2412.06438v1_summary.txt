Statement: Self-correction prompts appear more effective in more complex conjunction tasks.
Location: part 3
Exact Quote: Notably, self-correction appears more effective in more complex conjunction tasks, either performing comparably, or slightly outperforming the base model.

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: Providing the model with its previous response and additional time to reason does not improve performance on single-feature or conjunction tasks.
Location: part 3
Exact Quote: Longer Inference Time We also explored whether encouraging the model to engage in more deliberate reasoning, by providing it with additional context, could improve performance. Instead of simply providing the model with its previous observations (actions and outcomes), we also included its reasoning traces, explaining why it selected previous actions. This approach, while increasing inference time, allows the model to reflect on its own chain-of-thought, potentially leading to improved reasoning and better decision-making. Figure 4 presents the results of incorporating the model’s reasoning traces. In both single-feature and conjunction tasks, this approach, which encourages more deliberate reasoning, yields comparable performance to the baseline approach without reasoning traces.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Figure 4 presents the results of incorporating the model’s reasoning traces. In both single-feature and conjunction tasks, this approach, which encourages more deliberate reasoning, yields comparable performance to the baseline approach without reasoning traces.

Claim 5:
Type: result
Statement: Memory constraints also play a crucial role in limiting the performance of the standard Gemini policy.
Location: part 3
Exact Quote: While imperfect adherence to the guided strategy could be a factor, the gap between the guided reasoning model and the optimal policy widens as the number of unique colors increases. This strongly suggests that memory constraints also play a crucial role in limiting the performance of the standard Gemini policy.
