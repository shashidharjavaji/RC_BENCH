Exact Quote: we only use a single 32GB NVIDIA V100 GPU for all of our experiments. This is possible for us because, as mentioned in Sec. 5.1, we can pre-compute the latents from pre-trained unimodal encoders so that the underlying encoders can be discarded thereafter. Additionally, we can extract the latents for each modality one at a time to ensure that no more than one encoder must be loaded at once.

  Location: 6.3
  Limitations: Human-annotated data can be expensive and time-consuming to collect.

Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The use of DPPs and the comparison of human-annotated and web-scale data support the claim that dataset quality and diversity impact fusion performance.
