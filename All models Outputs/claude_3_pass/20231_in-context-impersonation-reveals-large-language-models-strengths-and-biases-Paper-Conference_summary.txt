Claim 1:
Statement: LLMs impersonating children of different ages can recover human-like developmental stages of exploration strategies
Location: Abstract
Type: Result finding
Quote: In a multi-armed bandit task, we find that LLMs pretending to be children of different ages recover human-like developmental stages of exploration.

Evidence:
- LLMs impersonating children showed higher levels of directed exploration compared to adults, matching psychological literature
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: Limited to one type of task (two-armed bandit)
  Quote: LLMs pretending to be older explored their environment less (β = -0.03, p < .001) and exploited more (β = 0.04, p < .001) in the ages between 2–20. This pattern is in line with several results from the psychological literature which also found that children show higher levels of directed exploration than adults

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited to two-armed bandit task only; may not generalize to other exploration tasks
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: LLMs impersonating domain experts perform better than non-domain experts in language-based reasoning tasks
Location: Abstract
Type: Result finding
Quote: In a language-based reasoning task, we find that LLMs impersonating domain experts perform better than LLMs impersonating non-domain experts.

Evidence:
- Task experts outperformed domain experts who outperformed non-domain experts across MMLU domains
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Performance varies by specific task/domain
  Quote: when the LLM is asked to impersonate the task expert, the performance is the highest. Similarly, the domain expert personas perform better than the non-domain expert personas. This trend holds for all four MMLU domains

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Limited to MMLU dataset; tested on only two LLMs
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: LLMs impersonating experts perform better at describing objects in their domain of expertise
Location: Abstract
Type: Result finding
Quote: We find that impersonation can improve performance: an LLM prompted to be a bird expert describes birds better than one prompted to be a car expert.

Evidence:
- Bird expert better described birds while car expert better described cars
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Limited to two specific domains
  Quote: car mechanic persona's descriptions performs better than ornithologist's when recognizing cars

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Only tested on birds and cars; may not generalize to other domains
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: LLMs show gender and racial biases in their impersonated descriptions
Location: Abstract
Type: Result finding
Quote: However, impersonation can also uncover LLMs' biases: an LLM prompted to be a man describes cars better than one prompted to be a woman.

Evidence:
- Racial and gender biases found in description performance
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Limited to specific object categories
  Quote: While the black performs better in car classification, the white performs better in bird classification... while the woman performs clearly better than man for bird classification, the trend is not as strong for car classification although man performs slightly better than woman

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited to binary gender/race categories; may reflect training data biases rather than real-world biases
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: LLMs impersonating older personas obtain higher rewards in bandit tasks than younger personas
Location: Results - Age-based impersonation section
Type: Result finding
Quote: Younger personas, i.e., 2- and 4-year-old personas, obtain a smaller reward than older ones, i.e., 13- and 20-year-old personas.

Evidence:
- Older personas obtained higher rewards in bandit task
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: Only tested up to age 20
  Quote: LLMs impersonating older participants generate higher average rewards until age 20 (β = 0.17, p < .001)

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Effect plateaus after age 20; tested only up to age 60
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: LLMs impersonating older personas explore less and exploit more in bandit tasks
Location: Results - Age-based impersonation section
Type: Result finding
Quote: LLMs pretending to be older explored their environment less (β = −0.03, p < .001) and exploited more (β = 0.04, p < .001) in the ages between 2–20.

Evidence:
- Older personas showed less exploration and more exploitation
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: Only tested ages 2-20
  Quote: LLMs pretending to be older explored their environment less (β = -0.03, p < .001) and exploited more (β = 0.04, p < .001) in the ages between 2–20

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Statistical significance only shown for ages 2-20, not 20-60
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 7:
Statement: Task expert personas perform better than domain expert personas in MMLU tasks
Location: Results - Expertise-based impersonation section
Type: Result finding
Quote: When the LLM is asked to impersonate the task expert, the performance is the highest... the domain expert personas perform better than the non-domain expert personas.

Evidence:
- Task experts outperformed domain experts on MMLU tasks
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Performance varied by specific task
  Quote: for World Religions and Human Aging, we observe that the task expert performs much better than the corresponding domain expert personas

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Performance varies by subject area; some tasks show weaker expert advantage
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 8:
Statement: ChatGPT shows larger effects of impersonation compared to Vicuna-13B
Location: Results - Vision and Language Task Design section
Type: Result finding
Quote: Overall, we find that ChatGPT shows larger effects, probably due to its access to more diverse (fine-tuning) data.

Evidence:
- ChatGPT showed more pronounced effects of impersonation
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Limited comparison
  Quote: The progression is particularly pronounced for ChatGPT... Overall, we find that ChatGPT shows larger effects, probably due to its access to more diverse (fine-tuning) data

Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: Limited quantitative comparison between models; insufficient statistical evidence presented
Confidence: low
