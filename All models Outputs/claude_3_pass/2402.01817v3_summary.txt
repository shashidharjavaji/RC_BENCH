=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: Auto-regressive LLMs cannot by themselves do planning or self-verification
Location: Abstract
Type: Primary limitation finding
Quote: We argue that auto-regressive LLMs cannot, by themselves, do planning or self-verification (which is after all a form of reasoning)

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: While the paper provides theoretical arguments, more detailed analysis of the fundamental limitations of autoregressive architectures would strengthen the claim
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: Only about 12% of plans generated by GPT-4 are executable without errors and goal-reaching
Location: Section 2.1
Type: Empirical result
Quote: On average, only about 12% of the plans that the best LLM (GPT-4) generates are actually executable without errors and goal-reaching.

Evidence:
- GPT-4 generates only about 12% executable plans on planning benchmarks
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.1
  Limitations: Specific domains tested not fully detailed
  Quote: On average, only about 12% of the plans that the best LLM (GPT-4) generates are actually executable without errors and goal-reaching.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Limited to specific planning benchmarks; may not generalize to all planning scenarios
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: Fine-tuning does not significantly improve LLMs' poor planning performance
Location: Section 2.1
Type: Empirical finding
Quote: We also show that fine-tuning does not seem to have a major effect on this dismal performance.

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: No specific evidence presented about fine-tuning experiments or results
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: Chain of thought and ReAct-style prompting are ineffective at improving LLMs' planning performance
Location: Section 2.1
Type: Empirical finding
Quote: More recently, we have also investigated so-called 'chain of thought' prompting, as well as ReAct-style step-by-step prompting and found that they too are largely ineffective in improving the planning performance of LLMs.

Evidence:
- Recent studies show chain of thought and ReAct prompting ineffective
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 2.1
  Limitations: Full experimental details not provided
  Quote: More recently, we have also investigated so-called 'chain of thought' prompting, as well as ReAct-style step-by-step prompting and found that they too are largely ineffective in improving the planning performance of LLMs.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: References studies but doesn't provide detailed results or methodology
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: LLMs cannot verify plans and self-critiquing does not improve performance
Location: Section 2.2
Type: Major limitation finding
Quote: Our results indicate that in direct mode, LLMs are, perhaps not surprisingly, pretty bad at solving graph coloring instances. More interestingly, they are no better at verifying solutions.

Evidence:
- LLMs perform poorly at verifying solutions and self-critiquing makes performance worse
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.2
  Limitations: Tested on specific problems like graph coloring
  Quote: Our results indicate that in direct mode, LLMs are, perhaps not surprisingly, pretty bad at solving graph coloring instances. More interestingly, they are no better at verifying solutions... the performance is in fact worse because the system can't recognize a correct coloring

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Evidence primarily from specific tasks like graph coloring and planning benchmarks
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: LLM-Modulo framework with external critics improves planning performance significantly
Location: Section 4
Type: Primary result
Quote: LLM-Modulo based agentification with automated critics in the loop significantly improves the performance (6x of baselines) even with a limit of 10 back prompting cycles, and weaker models such as GPT-3.5-turbo.

Evidence:
- LLM-Modulo improved performance 6x on travel planning benchmark
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: Only tested on one specific benchmark
  Quote: Our preliminary results show that LLM-Modulo based agentification with automated critics in the loop significantly improves the performance (6x of baselines) even with a limit of 10 back prompting cycles

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited to one case study (travel planning); needs more diverse validation
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 7:
Statement: LLMs can successfully implement functions corresponding to hard critics and common-sense critics
Location: Section 4
Type: Capability finding
Quote: Furthermore, we also find that LLMs can successfully implement functions corresponding to hard critics and several common-sense critics.

Evidence:
- LLMs successfully implemented critic functions in travel planning case study
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: Limited to one case study
  Quote: Furthermore, we also find that LLMs can successfully implement functions corresponding to hard critics and several common-sense critics.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: low
Limitations: Based on single case study; lacks detailed performance metrics or comparison baselines
Confidence: low
