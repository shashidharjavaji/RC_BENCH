==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: 73% of students prefer curated video libraries
Location: Abstract
Type: Statistical finding
Quote: However, the challenge of finding appropriate resources has led 73% of students to prefer curated video libraries.

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: no source or methodology provided for this statistic
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: The platform's vector database implementation improves domain-specific search accuracy
Location: Section 3.2 Vector Database Implementation
Type: Methodological contribution
Quote: Since the vector database contains only domain-specific vectors, the results will naturally be restricted to that domain.

Evidence:
- Vector database implementation is described in methodology but no experimental results are provided to support improved accuracy
  Strength: weak
  Location: Section 3.2 Vector Database Implementation
  Limitations: No quantitative results or comparisons provided
  Quote: When querying, we can further restrict the results to specific sub-domains by applying filters based on these metadata tags, ensuring more precise domain-specific outcomes.

Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: theoretical description only, no experimental validation or comparative results
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: Cubits.ai has become widely adopted in higher education
Location: Section 4.1 Platform Adoption and User Engagement
Type: Impact claim
Quote: cubits.ai has become widely adopted in higher education, with many instructors integrating it into their online learning systems.

Evidence:
- Platform adoption claim is made but without specific numbers or data
  Strength: weak
  Location: Section 4.1 Platform Adoption and User Engagement
  Limitations: No specific adoption metrics or comparative data provided
  Quote: cubits.ai has become widely adopted in higher education, with many instructors integrating it into their online learning systems. The platform is already serving thousands of students

Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: no adoption metrics, institutional numbers, or user statistics provided
Confidence: low

==================================================

Location: Section 4.3 Generalization Capabilities of LLMs in Educational Contexts
Type: Technical finding
Quote: The use of domain-specific vector databases significantly improves the relevance and accuracy of generated content

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: no comparative analysis or metrics showing improvement
Confidence: low

==================================================
