Claim 7:
Statement: REPLUG LSR outperforms various off-the-shelf retrievers and leads to additional improvements
Location: Introduction
Type: Performance Result
Quote: Furthermore, tuning the retriever with our training scheme (i.e., REPLUG LSR) outperforms various off-the-shelf retrievers and leads to additional improvements, including up to 6.3% increase in GPT-3 175B language modeling.

Evidence:
- LSR retriever outperforms other retrievers like BERT-base, DPR and BM25
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 7.3
  Limitations: Limited to specific test cases
  Quote: Among all off-the-shelf retrievers, the sparse retriever BM25 performs best. However, it still lags behind our LM supervised retriever (Contriever LSR)

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Limited set of baseline retrievers compared
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 8:
Statement: The performance gains from REPLUG stay consistent across different model sizes
Location: Analysis section
Type: Analysis Result
Quote: We observe that the performance gain brought by REPLUG stays consistent with model size. For example, OPT-125M achieves 6.9% perplexity improvement, while OPT-66B achieves 5.6% perplexity improvement.

Evidence:
- Performance gains are consistent across model sizes based on perplexity improvements
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 7.1
  Limitations: Only shown for specific model families
  Quote: the performance gain brought by REPLUG stays consistent with model size. For example, OPT-125M achieves 6.9% perplexity improvement, while OPT-66B achieves 5.6% perplexity improvement

Conclusion:
