Claim 4:
Statement: The MGN significantly eliminates false predictions caused by the modality and temporal uncertainties existing in the baseline.
Location: Section 4.3
Type: Novel finding, improvement, or advancement
Quote: Overall, our MGN with explicit grouping mechanisms significantly eliminates false predictions caused by the modality and temporal uncertainties existing in the baseline.

Evidence:
- We can observe that our MGN with the class-aware unimodal grouping modules decreases the false positives of audio and visual events by large margins, 381 and 494.

Claim 5:
Statement: The learned class-aware features are intra-class compact and inter-class separable.
Location: Section 4.3
Type: Novel finding, improvement, or advancement
Quote: As can be seen in the last column, features extracted by the proposed MGN are intra-class compact and inter-class separable.

Evidence:
- It is noted that each spot denotes the feature of one audio or visual event, while each color represents each class, such as “Speech” in brown and “Dog” in green. As can be seen in the last column, features extracted by the proposed MGN are intra-class compact and inter-class separable.
