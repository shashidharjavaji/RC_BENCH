    "raw_claims": "The provided text is a research paper titled \"REACT: SYNERGIZING REASONING AND ACTING IN LANGUAGE MODELS\" by Shunyu Yao et al. The paper introduces a novel paradigm called ReAct, which combines reasoning and acting in large language models for general task solving. Here's a summary of the paper in the requested format:\n\n**Claims:**\n\n1. **Claim:** ReAct outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever) tasks.\n**Location:** Abstract\n**Claim Type:** Methodology\n**Exact Quote:** \"ReAct overcomes prevalent issues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces.\"\n\n2. **Claim:** ReAct achieves an absolute success rate improvement of 34% and 10% over imitation and reinforcement learning methods on ALFWorld and WebShop decision-making tasks, respectively.\n**Location:** Abstract\n**Claim Type:** Results\n**Exact Quote:** \"On ALFWorld and WebShop, two or even one-shot ReAct prompting is able to outperform imitation or reinforcement learning methods trained with 10[3] 10[5] task instances, with an absolute improvement of 34% and 10% in success rates respectively.\"\n\n3. **Claim:** ReAct's combination of internal and external knowledge outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in HotpotQA and Fever tasks.\n**Location:** Section 3.2\n**Claim Type:** Methodology\n**Exact Quote:** \"The best approach overall is a combination of ReAct and CoT-SC that allows for the use of both internal knowledge and externally obtained information during reasoning.\"\n\n4. **Claim:** ReAct's fine-tuning approach on HotpotQA shows promising results, with PaLM-8B finetuned ReAct outperforming all PaLM-62B prompting methods.\n**Location:** Section 3.3\n**Claim Type:** Results\n**Exact Quote:** \"With PaLM-8B, prompting ReAct performs worst among four methods due to the difficulty to learn both reasoning and acting from in-context examples. However, when finetuned with just 3,000 examples, ReAct becomes the best method among the four, with PaLM-8B finetuned ReAct outperforming all PaLM-62B prompting methods.\"\n\n5. **Claim:** ReAct's human-in-the-loop interaction allows for easy task solving by editing a few thoughts, enabling new forms of human-machine collaboration.\n**Location:** Section A.3\n**Claim Type:** Methodology\n**Exact Quote:** \"By simply removing a hallucinating sentence in Act 17 and adding some hints in Act 23, ReAct can be made to change its behavior drastically to align with these human thought edits and succeed in the task.\"",
