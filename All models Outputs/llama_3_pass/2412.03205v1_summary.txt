Claim 3:
Statement: The highest accuracy achieved on U-MATH was 63.4% on text-based tasks and 45.0% on visual problems.
Location: Section 4.2
Type: Novel finding
Quote: Among text-only models, the math-specific model Qwen2.5-Math-72B achieves the highest overall accuracy at 50.2%, showcasing strong mathematical reasoning capabilities. In the multi-modal model group, Gemini-1.5-pro-002 leads with an overall accuracy of 60.1%, highlighting the advantages of integrating visual processing. In contrast, best open-weights model Qwen2-VL-72B lacks mathematical abilities in visual and textual tasks with 31.2% on a U-MATH benchmark.

  Limitations: None
  Quote: Among text-only models... the math-specific model Qwen2.5-Math-72B achieves the highest overall accuracy at 50.2%... In the multi-modal model group, Gemini-1.5-pro-002 leads with an overall accuracy of 60.1%... The highest accuracy achieved was 63.4% on text-based tasks and 45.0% on visual problems (Gemini-1.5-pro-002).

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high

Claim 4:
Statement: The best model achieved a macro F1-score of 80% on µ-MATH.
Location: Section 4.3
Type: Novel finding
Quote: Our results show that correctly identifying a positive label is harder on average compared to negative labels, with the best TPR being almost 10% lower than the best TNR, and that the best attainable F1 score is only 80%.

Evidence:
- The best model achieved a macro F1-score of 80% on µ-MATH.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3: META-EVALUATION (µ-MATH) RESULTS
  Limitations: None
  Quote: Our results show the best model achieving the macro F1-score of 80% on µ-MATH.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific to the models and tasks evaluated
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Judges show varying behaviors, they have imperfect performance that is also distinct from problem-solving performance, and different prompting schemes induce nontrivial changes in judges’ behaviors, biases, and even their performance rankings.
Location: Section 4.3
Type: Novel finding
Quote: Besides that, we observe substantive differences in judges’ behavior: proprietary models tend to be more conservative — having relatively high TNR compared to their TPR — while Qwen family of models exhibits the opposite pattern. The behavior differences are further studied and illustrated in Appendix I.

Evidence:
- Judges show varying behaviors, they have imperfect performance that is also distinct from problem-solving performance, and different prompting schemes induce nontrivial changes in judges’ behaviors, biases, and even their performance rankings.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3: META-EVALUATION (µ-MATH) RESULTS
  Limitations: None
  Quote: We find that using manual CoT instructions instead of the standard AutoCoT improves or maintains judgment performance... Judges show varying behaviors, they have imperfect performance that is also distinct from problem-solving performance, and different prompting schemes induce nontrivial changes in judges’ behaviors, biases, and even their performance rankings.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited to the specific prompting schemes and models evaluated
Confidence: medium
