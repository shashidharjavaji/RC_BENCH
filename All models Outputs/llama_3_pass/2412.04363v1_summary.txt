=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: Only 10% of poor quality annotations can change the rank of 2/3 systems by 5 places.
Location: Section 3.1
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: We find that only 10% of apathetic votes in the dataset can change the leaderboard rankings of 2/3 models by 5 places (namely Llama-2-13b-chat and Mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2).

Evidence:
- Table 1: Change in leaderboard rankings for 3 test models based on different percentages (r) of arbitrary votes.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.1
  Limitations: Limited to the specific experiment setup and models tested
  Quote: We find that only 10% poor quality annotations can change the rank of 2/3 systems by 5 places.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific models and dataset used in the study
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: Only 10% adversarial annotations can change the rank of all systems by more than 4 places.
Location: Section 3.2
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: Across all models, we show that adversarial attacks can substantially change leaderboard rankings if adversaries get to contribute 10% votes for their model.

Evidence:
- Table 2: Change in leaderboard rankings for 3 test models based on different percentages (r) of adversarial votes.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.2
  Limitations: Limited to the specific experiment setup and models tested
  Quote: Across all models, we show that adversarial attacks can substantially change leaderboard rankings if adversaries get to contribute 10% votes for their model.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific models and dataset used in the study
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: Arbitrary votes on open-ended queries can lead to low inter-annotator agreement, making it difficult to disentangle between low-quality annotations and inherent subjectivity.
Location: Section 3.3
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: More concerningly, the results highlight that traditional approaches like filtering out low-quality users/annotations using inter-annotator agreement may not be a viable strategy for open-ended queries as it is difficult to disentangle between of low inter-annotator agreement due to bad annotation (apathetic votes) or inherent subjectivity.

Evidence:
- Table 4: Fleissâ€™ Kappa between four annotators on different evaluation axis.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: Limited to a small-scale annotation study with specific models and evaluation axes
  Quote: Overall, we find very low agreement between these well-intentioned annotators with clear guidelines, irrespective of the performance difference between the model pairs.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited to open-ended queries and specific annotators
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: Richer feedback mechanisms, such as soliciting fine-grained annotations or rationales, can encourage apathetic users to think more critically about their votes and help filter out low-quality annotations.
Location: Section 4
Type: Methodological Improvement
Quote: We encourage the community to explore ideas from past research, such as soliciting fine-grained annotations (Krishna et al., 2023; Goyal et al., 2022b) or rationales (McDonnell et al., 2016) in addition to the binary preference feedback.

Evidence:
- Discussion in Section 4: Conclusion & Future Directions
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: Based on general discussion and past research, not a direct experimental result
  Quote: Rationales can be useful in encouraging apathetic users to think more critically about their votes (or abstain) and also for filtering out low-quality annotations from both apathetic and adversarial users.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Dependence on implementation and user behavior
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Stronger guardrails, such as reputation-based systems, CAPTCHA, machine learning-based anomaly detection, and techniques using annotator behavior traces, can help mitigate poor-quality annotations.
Location: Section 4
Type: Methodological Improvement
Quote: Other guardrails could include reputation-based systems (Adler and de Alfaro, 2007), CAPTCHA (Von Ahn et al., 2003, 2008), machine learning based anomaly detection (Kumar et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2016) and techniques that use annotator behavior traces on the platform to estimate quality (Goyal et al., 2018).

Evidence:
- Discussion in Section 4: Conclusion & Future Directions
  Strength: weak
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: General discussion without specific experimental results or data
  Quote: Other guardrails could include reputation-based systems, CAPTCHA, machine learning based anomaly detection, and techniques that use annotator behavior traces on the platform to estimate quality.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Effectiveness in real-world scenarios and potential for misuse
Confidence: medium
