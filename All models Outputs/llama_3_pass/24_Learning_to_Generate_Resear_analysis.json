    "raw_claims": "**Summary of the Research Paper**\n\n**Title:** Learning to Generate Research Ideas with Dynamic Control\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe paper proposes a novel framework for generating research ideas using large language models (LLMs) with dynamic control. The framework combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and controllable reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize research ideas across three key metrics: novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness. The approach uses multi-dimensional reward modeling, guided by fine-grained feedback, to evaluate and optimize generated ideas. Dimensional controllers enable dynamic adjustment of generation, ensuring context-aware emphasis during inference.\n\n**Main Contributions:**\n\n1. **Novel Framework:** A two-stage approach combining SFT and controllable RL for research idea generation.\n2. **Dynamic Control:** Dimensional controllers for novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness, allowing for fine-grained control at inference time.\n3. **Reward Modeling:** Multi-dimensional reward models trained on fine-grained feedback for evaluating research ideas.\n4. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Human study demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method for optimized, controllable research ideation.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Improved Performance:** The proposed framework outperforms baselines in novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness.\n2. **Trade-offs:** Increasing novelty may reduce feasibility, highlighting the importance of dynamic control.\n3. **Human Evaluation:** Strong correlation between human and reviewing agent scores, validating the framework's effectiveness.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):** Fine-tuning an LLM on pairs of research papers and follow-up ideas.\n2. **Controllable Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Using multi-dimensional reward models to evaluate and optimize generated ideas.\n3. **Dimensional Controllers:** Enabling dynamic adjustment of generation for novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness.\n4. **Dynamic Decoding:** Predicting controller weights for each sentence to ensure context-aware emphasis.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Automatic Evaluation:** Evaluating novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness using prompt-based methods.\n2. **Human Evaluation:** Domain experts assessing the quality of generated ideas, highlighting trade-offs between novelty and feasibility.\n\n**References:**\nThe paper cites various studies on LLMs, RL, and scientific discovery, including works on SciBERT, BioBERT, and WebGPT.",
