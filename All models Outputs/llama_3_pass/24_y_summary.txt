=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: There are features which can both distinguish AD patients from healthy controls with a high degree of accuracy, and also generalize across languages.
Location: Section 6: Conclusion and Future Work
Type: Novel finding
Quote: In this work, we have shown that there are features which can both distinguish AD patients from healthy controls with a high degree of accuracy, and also generalize across languages.

Evidence:
- The best overall result of AUC = 0.89 is achieved by combining the feature types in the ALL configuration.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Specific to the French dataset and the ALL configuration
  Quote: The best overall result of AUC = 0.89 is achieved by combining the feature types in the ALL configuration.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specifically, the features that generalize across languages are not explicitly identified in the evidence.
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: By incorporating a large English dataset, we were able to improve the AUC on the French dataset from 0.85 to 0.89.
Location: Section 6: Conclusion and Future Work
Type: Improvement
Quote: By incorporating a large English dataset, we were able to improve the AUC on the French dataset from 0.85 to 0.89.

Evidence:
- For French, the LM features generally do not benefit from domain adaptation, with equivalent or poorer AUC relative to the unilingual case. However, the info features do benefit from the additional data available through domain adaptation, and lead to better results than the unilingual baseline.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Specific to the French dataset and domain adaptation
  Quote: For French, the LM features generally do not benefit from domain adaptation, with equivalent or poorer AUC relative to the unilingual case. However, the info features do benefit from the additional data available through domain adaptation, and lead to better results than the unilingual baseline.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: The improvement in AUC is specific to the ALL configuration and the info features.
Confidence: high

Claim 3:
Statement: We developed a new set of features for this task, using concept-based language modelling, which improved AUC from 0.80 to 0.85 in the unilingual case, and 0.88 to 0.89 in the multilingual case.
Location: Section 6: Conclusion and Future Work
Type: Novel contribution
Quote: We also developed a new set of features for this task, using concept-based language modelling, which improved AUC from 0.80 to 0.85 in the unilingual case, and 0.88 to 0.89 in the multilingual case.

Evidence:
- We also developed a new set of features for this task, using concept-based language modelling, which improved AUC from 0.80 to 0.85 in the unilingual case, and 0.88 to 0.89 in the multilingual case.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: Specific to the concept-based language modelling
  Quote: We also developed a new set of features for this task, using concept-based language modelling, which improved AUC from 0.80 to 0.85 in the unilingual case, and 0.88 to 0.89 in the multilingual case.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: The improvement in AUC is specific to the unilingual and multilingual cases, and the specific feature set (concept-based language modelling).
Confidence: high
