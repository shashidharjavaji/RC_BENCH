=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: Language models can be used to generate high-quality evaluations with significantly less human effort.
Location: Abstract
Type: Novel finding
Quote: As language models (LMs) scale, they develop many novel behaviors, good and bad, exacerbating the need to evaluate how they behave. Prior work creates evaluations with crowdwork (which is time-consuming and expensive) or existing data sources (which are not always available). Here, we automatically generate evaluations with LMs.

Evidence:
- We generate 154 datasets and discover new cases of inverse scaling where LMs get worse with size.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.5
  Limitations: None
  Quote: We generate 154 datasets and discover new cases of inverse scaling where LMs get worse with size.

- A single dataset developer can generate >100 evaluations at once, enabling them to evaluate models at a scale and speed that is not achievable with manual creation;
  Strength: strong

  Limitations: None
  Quote: A single dataset developer can generate >100 evaluations at once, enabling them to evaluate models at a scale and speed that is not achievable with manual creation;

Conclusion:
Justified: True

Claim 2:
Statement: The proposed approach retains the flexibility of manual dataset creation while having several major advantages, including being significantly cheaper, lower effort, and faster than manual data creation.
Location: Introduction
Type: Contribution
Quote: Our approach retains the flexibility of manual dataset creation while having several major advantages. LM-based data creation is significantly cheaper, lower effort, and faster than manual data creation. A single dataset developer can generate >100 evaluations at once, enabling them to evaluate models at a scale and speed that is not achievable with manual creation; a dataset of 1,000 examples can be generated in minutes instead of days or weeks.

Evidence:
- The proposed approach retains the flexibility of manual dataset creation while having several major advantages, including being significantly cheaper, lower effort, and faster than manual data creation.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 1
  Limitations: None
