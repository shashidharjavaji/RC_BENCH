Historically, data augmentations were introduced in an effort to synthetically increase dataset size and diversity [43, 73]: this is exactly our goal, as we operate in a setting with relatively scarce paired multimodal data. In the natural image domain, common augmentations include horizontal flips, random crops, and color jitter [6, 13], which were designed to leave semantic information unchanged. However, designing such augmentations in any given domain requires expert knowledge of which transformations preserve semantic information. For example, na\u00a8\u0131vely applying color jitter on the medical image domain can destroy the most relevant information for tasks like cancer classification [72, 77]. Furthermore, handcrafted augmentation schemes typically do not readily transfer to other modalities. This effect is evidenced by the scarcity of modality-agnostic augmentation schemes, despite recent efforts therein such as random projections [77] and randomized quantization [94]. We note that while input masking has been successfully applied in various modalities, expert knowledge is still required to determine an appropriate masking strategy for each modality individually [21, 32, 34, 84]. Given these challenges, it is unsurprising that data augmentations are not as well studied for multimodal learning [30]. In our work, we propose a multimodal augmentation scheme that operates on latent space and is inspired by mixup."

                "exact_quote": "Given our aim of performing multimodal fusion with minimal samples of paired data, it would seem intuitive to also leverage data augmentations to generate synthetic multimodal pairs (\u02dcx, \u02dcy). However, constructing semantically meaningful data augmentations directly on the ambient spaces and is generally challenging due to the heterogeneity of multimodal data [30]. On the other hand, we note that ZX and ZY provide a more homogeneous alternative since they are both intermediate latent spaces of pre-trained unimodal encoders. Additionally, they already encode semantic information that can be beneficial for creating meaningful data augmentations. As such, we introduce a simple yet effective multimodal augmentation scheme on latent space that is agnostic to both the involved modalities and the choice of unimodal encoders. Our approach, which we call FuseMix, is inspired by mixup [106], in that augmented samples are generated from random convex combinations. In particular, we take linear interpolations between samples in both ZX and ZY. Importantly, since both latent spaces are taken from pretrained unimodal encoders, we should expect linear interpolations to be more semantically meaningful than when carried out on ambient space, as is typically done in mixup [44, 87, 106]. We note that this idea of semantic interpolations in latent space is reminiscent of latent space arithmetic that has a well-established history [24, 27, 59, 66]. However, na\u00a8\u0131vely mixing random samples in each latent space would only produce augmented pairs of latents (\u02dczx, \u02dczy) \u2208ZX \u00d7 ZY where \u02dczx and \u02dczy are unrelated to one another. Therefore, we want to impose some structure on how interpolations are performed across modalities to ensure that we can construct semantically meaningful augmented pairs. To achieve this we take any two existing positive multimodal pairs (zx, zy) \u225c (gX (x), gY (y)) and i.i.d. (\u02c6zx, \u02c6zy) \u225c (gX (\u02c6x), gY (\u02c6y)), where (x, y), (\u02c6x, \u02c6y) \u223c pX,Y, and construct a corresponding augmentation (\u02dczx, \u02dczy) as \u03bb (zx, zy) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb) (\u02c6zx, \u02c6zy), where \u03bb (0, 1) is the shared interpolation coefficient. \u2207"
