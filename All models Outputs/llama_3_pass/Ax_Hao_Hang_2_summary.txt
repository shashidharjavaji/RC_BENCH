Claim 3:
Statement: Integrated gradients can be efficiently approximated via a summation, requiring only a few calls to the gradients operator.
Location: Section 5
Type: Methodological Contribution
Quote: The integral of integrated gradients can be efficiently approximated via a summation. We simply sum the gradients at points occurring at sufficiently small intervals along the straightline path from the baseline x[â€²] to the input x.
