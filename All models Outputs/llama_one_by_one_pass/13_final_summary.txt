Claim 1:
Statement: DPR outperforms BM25 by a large margin (65.2% vs. 42.9% in Top-5 accuracy) on the Natural Questions dataset.
Location: Section 5.1

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 2: Top-20 & Top-100 retrieval accuracy on test sets, measured as the percentage of top 20/100 retrieved passages that contain the answer.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.1
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: DPR Single BM25 + DPR |78.4 79.4 73.2 79.8 63.2 76.6 79.8 71.0 85.2 71.5|

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: DPR outperforms BM25 by a large margin (65.2% vs. 42.9% in Top-5 accuracy) on the Natural Questions dataset.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a direct comparison of the two models (DPR and BM25) on the same dataset (Natural Questions) and metric (Top-5 accuracy).
  Limitations: The comparison is limited to a single dataset (Natural Questions) and a specific metric (Top-5 accuracy).
  Location: Section 5.1

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Statement: The DPR model used in our main experiments is trained using the in-batch negative setting with a batch size of 128 and one additional BM25 negative passage per question.
Location: Section 5.2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We trained the question and passage encoders for up to 40 epochs for large datasets (NQ, TriviaQA, SQuAD) and 100 epochs for small datasets (TREC, WQ), with a learning rate of 10[−][5] using Adam, linear scheduling with warm-up and dropout rate 0.1. While it is good to have the flexibility to adapt the retriever to each dataset, it would also be desirable to obtain a single retriever that works well across the board. To this end, we train a multidataset encoder by combining training data from all datasets excluding SQuAD. In addition to DPR, we also present the results of BM25, the traditional retrieval method[9] and BM25+DPR, using a linear combination of their scores as the new ranking function. ·

Claim 3:
Statement: The choice of negatives — random, BM25 or gold passages — does not impact the top-k accuracy much in the standard 1-of-N training setting when k ≥ 20.
Location: Section 5.2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The top block is the standard 1-of-N training setting, where each question in the batch is paired with a positive passage and its own set of n negative passages (Eq. (2)).

Claim 5:
Statement: Adding a single BM25 negative passage improves the result substantially while adding two does not help further.

Claim 8:
Statement: Our DPR-based models outperform the previous state-of-the-art results on four out of the five datasets, with 1% to 12% absolute differences in exact match accuracy.
Location: Section 6.2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 4 summarizes our final end-to-end QA results, measured by exact match with the reference answer after minor normalization as in (Chen et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019). From the table, we can see that higher retriever accuracy typically leads to better final QA results: in all cases except SQuAD, answers extracted from the passages retrieved by DPR are more likely to be correct, compared to those from BM25. For large datasets like NQ and TriviaQA, models trained using multiple datasets (Multi) perform comparably to those trained using the individual training set (Single). Conversely, on smaller datasets like WQ and TREC, the multidataset setting has a clear advantage. Overall, our DPR-based models outperform the previous state-of-the-art results on four out of the five datasets, with 1% to 12% absolute differences in exact match accuracy.

Claim 9:
Statement: DPR manages to outperform ORQA and REALM on both NQ and TriviaQA, simply by focusing on learning a strong passage retrieval model using pairs of questions and answers.
Location: Section 6.2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 4 summarizes our final end-to-end QA results, measured by exact match with the reference answer after minor normalization as in (Chen et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019).

Overall, our DPR-based models outperform the previous state-of-the-art results on four out of the five datasets, with 1% to 12% absolute differences in exact match accuracy. It is interesting to contrast our results to those of ORQA (Lee et al., 2019) and also the currently developed approach, REALM (Guu et al., 2020). While both methods include additional pretraining tasks and employ an expensive end-to-end training regime, DPR manages to outperform them on both NQ and TriviaQA, simply by focusing on learning a strong passage retrieval model using pairs of questions and answers.

Claim 11:
Statement: Our strategy of training a strong retriever and reader in isolation can leverage effectively available supervision, while outperforming a comparable joint training approach with a simpler design.
Location: Section 6.2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: One thing worth noticing is that our reader does consider more passages compared to ORQA, although it is not completely clear how much more time it takes for inference. While DPR processes up to 100 passages for each question, the reader is able to fit all of them into one batch on a single 32GB GPU, thus the latency remains almost identical to the single passage case (around 20ms).
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6.2
  Limitations: Does not provide a direct comparison of inference time
  Exact Quote: One thing worth noticing is that our reader does consider more passages compared to ORQA, although it is not completely clear how much more time it takes for inference.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Our strategy of training a strong retriever and reader in isolation can leverage effectively available supervision, while outperforming a comparable joint training approach with a simpler design.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it provides concrete numbers (e.g., 20ms latency) and a direct comparison to a baseline (ORQA). However, the robustness could be improved by providing more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and its implications on various hardware setups.

Claim 14:
Statement: We found k = 50 to be optimal for NQ, and k = 10 leads to only marginal loss in exact match accuracy (40.8 vs. 41.5 EM on NQ), which should be roughly comparable to ORQA’s 5-passage setup.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors found that using 50 passages (k=50) for the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset yields optimal results, with a marginal loss in exact match accuracy when using only 10 passages (k=10), making it comparable to ORQA's 5-passage setup.

  Limitations: The conclusion is specific to the NQ dataset and the authors' model. It may not generalize to other datasets or models. Additionally, the comparison to ORQA's 5-passage setup is based on a rough estimate and might not be exact.
