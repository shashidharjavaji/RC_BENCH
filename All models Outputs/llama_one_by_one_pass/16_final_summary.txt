Claim 3:
Statement: EUREKA generates novel rewards that outperform human ones, with an average correlation of 0.23.
Location: Section 4.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: EUREKA mostly generates weakly correlated reward functions that outperform the human ones. As shown, the harder the task is, the less correlated the EUREKA rewards.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3, Figure 6
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: EUREKA mostly generates weakly correlated reward functions that outperform the human ones. As shown, the harder the task is, the less correlated the EUREKA rewards.

- Evidence Text: The average correlation between EUREKA and human rewards is not explicitly stated in the provided text snippet. However, the claim mentions an average correlation of 0.23, which is not supported by the provided evidence.
  Strength: weak
  Location: Claim text
  Limitations: Lack of explicit correlation value in the provided text
  Exact Quote: None

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: EUREKA generates novel rewards that outperform human ones, with an average correlation of 0.23.
  Conclusion Justified: No
  Robustness: The evidence is partially robust, as it does show that EUREKA generates weakly correlated reward functions that outperform human ones. However, the lack of explicit correlation value weakens the overall conclusion.
  Limitations: The claim relies on an unstated average correlation value, which may not be accurate.
  Location: Section 4.3

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 4:
Statement: EUREKA can improve and benefit from human reward initialization, with an average improvement of 15.6%.
Location: Section 4.4

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: EUREKA (Human Init.) is uniformly better than both EUREKA and Human on all tasks, with an average improvement of 15.6% over Human.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: As shown, regardless of the quality of the human rewards, EUREKA improves and benefits from human rewards as EUREKA (Human Init.) is uniformly better than both EUREKA and Human on all tasks. This suggests that EUREKA’s in-context reward improvement capability is largely independent of the quality of the base reward. Furthermore, the fact that EUREKA can significantly improve over human rewards even when they are highly sub-optimal hints towards an interesting hypothesis: human designers are generally knowledgeable about relevant state variables but are less proficient at designing rewards using them.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: EUREKA can improve and benefit from human reward initialization, with an average improvement of 15.6%.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a comprehensive evaluation across all tasks, demonstrating a consistent trend of improvement. However, the absolute improvement value (15.6%) might be influenced by the specific tasks and environments used in the evaluation.
  Limitations: The evaluation is limited to the specific tasks and environments used in the study. Further research is needed to generalize these findings to other tasks and environments.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: EUREKA can be effectively combined with curriculum learning to acquire complex dexterous skills, such as pen spinning, demonstrating its applicability to advanced policy learning approaches.

Claim 7:
Statement: EUREKA's evolutionary optimization is indispensable for its final performance, with an average improvement of 23.1% over 5 iterations.
Location: Section 4.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: EUREKA’s rewards steadily improve and eventually surpass human rewards in performance despite sub-par initial performances.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: As seen, on both benchmarks, EUREKA rewards steadily improve and eventually surpass human rewards in performance despite sub-par initial performances.

- Evidence Text: The ablation EUREKA w.o. Evolution (32 Samples) performs lower than EUREKA after 2 iterations on both benchmarks.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Limited to 2 iterations
  Exact Quote: As seen, on both benchmarks, EUREKA rewards steadily improve and eventually surpass human rewards in performance despite sub-par initial performances. This consistent improvement also cannot be replaced by just sampling more in the first iteration as the ablation’s performances are lower than EUREKA after 2 iterations on both benchmarks.

- Evidence Text: The average improvement of EUREKA over 5 iterations is not explicitly stated in the provided text.
  Strength: weak
  Location: None
  Limitations: Lack of explicit statement
  Exact Quote: None

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: EUREKA's evolutionary optimization is indispensable for its final performance, with an average improvement of 23.1% over 5 iterations.
  Conclusion Justified: No
  Robustness: The evidence provided is robust in demonstrating the improvement of EUREKA's rewards over iterations. However, the lack of explicit information about the average improvement percentage reduces the overall robustness of the evidence in supporting the full claim.
  Limitations: The claim's specificity regarding the average improvement percentage is not supported by the provided evidence.

Claim 9:
Statement: EUREKA can discover novel reward design principles that may run counter to human intuition, with an average correlation of -0.12 with human rewards.
Location: Section 4.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: EUREKA generates novel rewards. We assess the novelty of EUREKA rewards by computing the correlations between EUREKA and human rewards on all the Isaac tasks; see App. B for details on this procedure. Then, we plot the correlations against the human normalized scores on a scatter-plot in Figure 6, where each point represents a single EUREKA reward on a single task. As shown, EUREKA mostly generates weakly correlated reward functions that outperform the human ones. In addition, by examining the average correlation by task (App. F), we observe that the harder the task is, the less correlated the EUREKA rewards.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: EUREKA generates novel rewards...the less correlated the EUREKA rewards.

- Evidence Text: In a few cases, EUREKA rewards are even negatively correlated with human rewards but perform significantly better, demonstrating that EUREKA can discover novel reward design principles that may run counter to human intuition; we illustrate these EUREKA rewards in App. G.2.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Limited to a few cases
  Exact Quote: In a few cases, EUREKA rewards are even negatively correlated with human rewards but perform significantly better...

  Author's Conclusion: EUREKA can discover novel reward design principles that may run counter to human intuition, with an average correlation of -0.12 with human rewards.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a thorough analysis of correlations across multiple tasks, providing a comprehensive understanding of EUREKA's capabilities.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the Isaac tasks and may not generalize to other environments or tasks.
