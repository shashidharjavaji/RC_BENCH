Location: Abstract

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors introduce two benchmarks: MT-bench, a multi-turn question set, and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We introduce two benchmarks with human ratings as the primary evaluation metric: MT-bench, a series of open-ended questions that evaluate a chatbot’s multi-turn conversational and instruction-following ability – two critical elements for human preference. MT-bench is also carefully constructed to differentiate chatbots based on their core capabilities, such as reasoning and math. In addition, we develop Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourcing benchmark platform featuring anonymous battles between chatbots in real-world scenarios – Users engage in conversations with two chatbots at the same time and rate their responses based on personal preferences.

Claim 5:
Statement: The authors propose a hybrid evaluation framework for future LLM benchmarks, combining existing capability-based benchmarks and new preference-based benchmarks with LLM-as-a-judge.
Location: Section 5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We evaluate several model variants derived from LLaMA on MMLU [19], Truthful QA [26] (MC1), and MT-bench (GPT-4 judge). The training details are in Appendix E. Since we have shown that GPT-4 single-answer grading also performs well in Section 4.2, we use GPT-4 single-answer grading for MT-bench in favor of its scalability and simplicity.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We evaluate several model variants derived from LLaMA on MMLU [19], Truthful QA [26] (MC1), and MT-bench (GPT-4 judge).

  Author's Conclusion: The authors propose a hybrid evaluation framework for future LLM benchmarks, combining existing capability-based benchmarks and new preference-based benchmarks with LLM-as-a-judge.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from multiple benchmarks and model evaluations. The alignment of the evidence with the conclusion is strong, as it directly supports the proposed hybrid framework.
  Limitations: The limitations of the evidence include the reliance on a single LLM model (GPT-4) for the evaluation and the potential for biases in the LLM-as-a-judge approach. Additionally, the generalizability of the results to other LLM models and benchmarks is not extensively explored.
  Location: Section 5

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 6:
Statement: The authors identify position bias as a limitation of LLM-as-a-judge, where an LLM exhibits a propensity to favor certain positions over others.
Location: Section 3.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 2: Position bias of different LLM judges. Consistency is the percentage of cases where a judge gives consistent results when swapping the order of two assistants. “Biased toward first” is the percentage of cases when a judge favors the first answer. “Error” indicates wrong output formats.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Position bias is when an LLM exhibits a propensity to favor certain positions over others.

- Evidence Text: Figure 11: An example of position bias. When Assistant A is placed in the first position, GPT-4 thinks A is better, but its verdict changes when we swap the position of A and B.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Appendix
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We observe similar pattern from other LLM judges such as Claude/GPT-3.5.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors identify position bias as a limitation of LLM-as-a-judge, where an LLM exhibits a propensity to favor certain positions over others.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on empirical results from experiments with LLM judges. The table provides a quantitative measure of position bias, and the figure offers a concrete example of the phenomenon.
  Limitations: The study's limitations include the potential for other biases, such as verbosity bias or self-enhancement bias, which may influence the results. Additionally, the experiment's design may not capture all possible scenarios where position bias could occur.
  Location: Section 3.3

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 7:
Statement: The authors propose swapping positions as a solution to address position bias.
Location: Section 3.4

Evidence:
  None
Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Swapping positions can address position bias by ensuring consistent results when the order of two answers is swapped.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a logical analysis of the position bias phenomenon. Swapping positions is a simple yet effective solution that can be widely applied to various evaluation scenarios.
  Limitations: One potential limitation is that this approach may not completely eliminate position bias, as the judge may still be influenced by subtle cues. Additionally, this method may not be suitable for all types of evaluations, such as those requiring a nuanced understanding of the context.
  Location: Section 3.4

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 8:
Statement: The authors identify verbosity bias as a limitation of LLM-as-a-judge, where an LLM favors longer, verbose responses.
Location: Section 3.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: To examine this bias, we design a “repetitive list” attack with model answers from MT-bench. We first select 23 model answers from MT-bench that contain a numbered list. We then make them unnecessarily verbose by asking GPT-4 to rephrase the list without adding any new information and insert the rephrased new list to the beginning of the original list.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: To examine this bias, we design a “repetitive list” attack with model answers from MT-bench.

- Evidence Text: Table 3 shows the failure rate of LLM judges under this attack, demonstrating that all LLMs may be prone to verbosity bias though GPT-4 defends significantly better than others.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Table 3: Failure rate under “repetitive list” attack for different LLM judges on 23 answers.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors identify verbosity bias as a limitation of LLM-as-a-judge, where an LLM favors longer, verbose responses.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a systematic attack designed to test for verbosity bias. The results are clear and consistent, with all LLMs except GPT-4 showing a high failure rate. However, the sample size of 23 model answers might be considered relatively small, which could be a limitation.
  Limitations: Sample size of 23 model answers might be considered relatively small.
  Location: Section 3.3

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 9:
Statement: The authors propose a reference-guided method to mitigate the limited grading ability for math questions.
Location: Section 3.4

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We propose two simple methods to mitigate this issue: chain-of-thought judge and reference-guided judge. Chain-of-thought is a widely used technique to improve LLM’s reasoning capability [47]. We propose a similar technique to prompt an LLM judge to begin with answering the question independently and then start grading. Detailed prompt in Figure 7 (Appendix). However, even with the CoT prompt, we find that in many cases LLM makes exactly the same mistake as the given answers in its problem-solving process (See example in Figure 15 (Appendix), suggesting that LLM judge may still be misled by the context. Hence, we propose a reference-guided method, in which we first generate LLM judge’s answer independently, and then display it as a reference answer in the judge prompt. In Table 4, we see a significant improvement in failure rate (from 70% to 15%) over the default prompt.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.4
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We propose two simple methods to mitigate this issue: chain-of-thought judge and reference-guided judge.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors propose a reference-guided method to mitigate the limited grading ability for math questions.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on experimental results (Table 4) and provides a clear explanation for the proposed methods. The chain-of-thought judge is also a widely used technique to improve LLM’s reasoning capability, adding to the robustness of the evidence.
  Limitations: The study does not explore other potential methods to mitigate the limited grading ability, and the effectiveness of the reference-guided method may vary depending on the specific context or LLM model used.

Claim 10:
Statement: The authors evaluate several model variants derived from LLaMA on MMLU, Truthful QA, and MT-bench (GPT-4 judge).
Location: Section 5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The training details are in Appendix E. Since we have shown that GPT-4 single-answer grading also performs well in Section 4.2, we use GPT-4 single-answer grading for MT-bench in favor of its scalability and simplicity. We ask GPT-4 to give a score for each turn on a scale of 10 by using our prompt templates (Figure 6, Figure 10) and report an average score of 160 = 80 2 turns. Table 8 shows the results.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We evaluate several model variants derived from LLaMA on MMLU, Truthful QA, and MT-bench (GPT-4 judge).

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors evaluate several model variants derived from LLaMA on MMLU, Truthful QA, and MT-bench (GPT-4 judge), finding that fine-tuning on high-quality dialog datasets consistently improves model performance on MMLU, and that a small high-quality conversation dataset can quickly teach the model a style preferred by GPT-4 (or approximately human) but cannot improve MMLU significantly.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a comprehensive evaluation of multiple model variants on three different benchmarks. The results are consistent across different evaluation metrics, providing strong support for the authors' conclusion.
  Limitations: The study only evaluates a limited number of model variants, and the results may not generalize to other models or benchmarks. Additionally, the evaluation is based on a single judge (GPT-4), which may introduce some bias in the results.

Location: Section 5

Evidence:
  None
Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Fine-tuning on high-quality dialog datasets can consistently improve model performance on MMLU.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from multiple model variants, providing a clear trend of improvement with increasing fine-tuning data size.

  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: Limited to the specific models and datasets used
  Exact Quote: We find that fine-tuning on high-quality dialog datasets can consistently improve the model performance on MMLU and the improvement scales with fine-tuning data size.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that using LLM-as-a-judge to approximate human preferences is highly feasible and could become a new standard in future benchmarks.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on experiments conducted on two different benchmarks (MT-bench and Chatbot Arena) and evaluates multiple model variants. The results consistently show the feasibility of LLM-as-a-judge, increasing the confidence in the conclusion.
  Limitations: The study focuses on a specific set of models and benchmarks, which might not be representative of all possible scenarios. Further research is needed to generalize the findings to other models and contexts.
