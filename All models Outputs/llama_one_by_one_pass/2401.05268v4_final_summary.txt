Claim 4:
Statement: Multi-agent architectures generally exhibit better performance than single-agent architectures.
Location: Section 5 Analysis

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Under identical settings, multi-agent architectures generally exhibit better performance than single-agent (REACT vs. BOLAA, FIREACT vs. AUTOACT), which aligns with Simon’s theory of bounded rationality.

  Limitations: The analysis is based on a specific comparison and may not generalize to all scenarios.
  Exact Quote: Under identical settings, multi-agent architectures generally exhibit better performance than single-agent (REACT vs. BOLAA, FIREACT vs. AUTOACT), which aligns with Simon’s theory of bounded rationality.

- Evidence Text: However, the performance of Chameleon, a single-agent architecture, outperforms BOLAA (even FIREACT on ScienceQA), which seems to contradict the claim. Further analysis reveals that Chameleon’s process of deciding tool parameters can be considered a form of tool invocation, and its specialized few-shot prompts guide the model through this process, exhibiting features resembling a multi-agent architecture.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: The analysis is based on a specific comparison and may not generalize to all scenarios.

Claim 5:
Statement: Excessive fine-grained division-of-labor is not the best approach.

Claim 6:
Statement: Maximizing the diversity of the synthesized data in the database may be a key improvement direction for AUTOACT.
Location: Section 7 Conclusion and Future Work

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: From Fig. 3 (a-c), we can observe that the overall performance of different models goes to stability with minimal waves once the data scale exceeds 200.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We speculate that this may be due to the limited ability of naive self-instruct to boost internal knowledge of the language model. As the training data increases, the knowledge which can be extracted through self-instruct decreases.

- Evidence Text: Despite our efforts to filter out duplicate data, the mindless increase can inevitably lead to a significant surge in similar data, which undermines the benefits of increasing the data scale and makes it challenging to improve model performance or even leads to over-fitting.
