--------------------------------------------------

Claim 5:
Statement: The evaluation of mathematical problems is not straightforward, and even simple expressions may have valid forms like x · 0.5 may have valid forms like [x]2 [,][ x][ ÷][ 2][,][ x/][2][, or unsimplified variants like][ 9][x/][18][.
Location: Section 3.3

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The evaluation of mathematical problems is not straightforward, and even simple expressions may have valid forms like x · 0.5 may have valid forms like [x]2 [,][ x][ ÷][ 2][,][ x/][2][, or unsimplified variants like][ 9][x/][18][.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes

The difference between the golden answer and the LLM-generated answer highlights the potential for errors or discrepancies in evaluation, even for simple expressions.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 6:
Statement: The best attainable F1 score is only 80.7% on the µ-MATH benchmark.
Location: Section 4.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 5: Comparison of model’s ability to judge on µ-MATH benchmark using CoT prompting; Macro F1-score (F1), True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) are presented, with F1 as the primary one.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Our results, for instance, reveal a consistent bias towards some models — better performance on Llama solutions and worse performance on Qwen solutions — most pronounced with smaller-sized judges and AutoCoT prompting. This bias is generally reduced for both small and large judges when transitioning to CoT prompting, which is also illustrated with Figure 3. At the same time, no noticeable ‘self-judgment’ effects are found. It is also evident that being a better solver does not necessarily lead to being a better judge. In fact, our results suggest a trade-off existing between these skill; refer to Appendix H for visualizations and a more detailed discussion. The best attainable F1 score is only 80.7% on the µ-MATH benchmark.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The best attainable F1 score is only 80.7% on the µ-MATH benchmark.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a comprehensive evaluation of multiple models using a well-defined metric (F1 score). However, the robustness may be limited by the specific prompting scheme used (CoT) and the evaluation setup.
  Limitations: The conclusion is limited to the specific evaluation setup and prompting scheme used. Different prompting schemes or evaluation methods may yield different results.
  Location: Section 4.3

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 7:
Statement: Judges show varying behaviors, they have imperfect performance that is also distinct from problem-solving performance, and different prompting schemes induce nontrivial changes in judges’ behaviors, biases, and even their performance rankings.
Location: Section 4.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The results in Table 5 show that using manual CoT instructions instead of the standard AutoCoT improves or maintains judgment performance, save for Llama models, as shown in Table 5. Additionally, the results reveal a consistent bias towards some models — better performance on Llama solutions and worse performance on Qwen solutions — most pronounced with smaller-sized judges and AutoCoT prompting.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We find that using manual CoT instructions instead of the standard AutoCoT improves or maintains judgment performance, save for Llama models, as shown in Table 5. Additionally, the results reveal a consistent bias towards some models — better performance on Llama solutions and worse performance on Qwen solutions — most pronounced with smaller-sized judges and AutoCoT prompting.

- Evidence Text: The results in Table 5 also show that being a better solver does not necessarily lead to being a better judge. In fact, the results suggest a trade-off existing between these skills; refer to Appendix H for visualizations and a more detailed discussion.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: It is also evident that being a better solver does not necessarily lead to being a better judge. In fact, our results suggest a trade-off existing between these skill; refer to Appendix H for visualizations and a more detailed discussion.

- Evidence Text: Figure 3 illustrates the relative differences between specific judgment performance — i.e., over samples with solutions generated by a specific author model — and integral judgment performance across all the samples. The judgment performance is measured by the µ-MATH macro F1-scores.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Besides that, we observe substantive differences in judges’ behavior: proprietary models tend to be more conservative — having relatively high TNR compared to their TPR — while Qwen family of models exhibits the opposite pattern.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Judges show varying behaviors, they have imperfect performance that is also distinct from problem-solving performance, and different prompting schemes induce nontrivial changes in judges’ behaviors, biases, and even their performance rankings.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from a comprehensive evaluation of various judges and prompting schemes, providing a thorough understanding of the judges' behaviors and performance.
  Limitations: The study's focus on a specific set of judges and prompting schemes might limit the generalizability of the findings to other contexts.
  Location: Section 4.3

Claim 8:
Statement: Being a better solver does not necessarily lead to being a better judge.
Location: Section 4.3

Evidence:

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Our results suggest a trade-off existing between these skill; refer to Appendix H for visualizations and a more detailed discussion.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that being a better solver does not necessarily lead to being a better judge, based on their results suggesting a trade-off between these skills.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on empirical results from the authors' experiments. However, the analysis could be strengthened by considering additional factors that might influence the trade-off, such as model architecture or training data.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific models and tasks evaluated in the study. Further research is needed to generalize the findings to other models and tasks.
  Location: Section 4.3

Claim 9:
Statement: The inclusion of 20% visual problems, yet reflecting real distribution, limits the evaluation of visual reasoning.
Location: Section 5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The U-MATH benchmark includes 225 of 1,100 university-level problems that require visual elements (graph, table, diagram) to be solved, mirroring the multi-modal nature of real-world mathematical problems.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: The U-MATH benchmark comprises 1,100 carefully curated and validated mathematical problems. These problems are distributed across 6 core subjects with about 20% of the tasks incorporating visual elements, such as graphs, tables, and geometric figures, mirroring the multi-modal nature of real-world mathematical problems:

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The inclusion of 20% visual problems in U-MATH limits the evaluation of visual reasoning.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is moderately robust, as it is based on the actual composition of the U-MATH benchmark. However, the conclusion's strength relies on the assumption that a higher proportion of visual problems would lead to a more comprehensive evaluation of visual reasoning.
  Limitations: The conclusion does not provide a clear threshold for what constitutes a sufficient proportion of visual problems for a comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, it does not account for the complexity or diversity of visual problems, which could also impact the evaluation's comprehensiveness.
