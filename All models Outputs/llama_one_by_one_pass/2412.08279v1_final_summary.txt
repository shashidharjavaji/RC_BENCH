Claim 5:
Statement: The English documents outnumber Yorùbá documents mainly due to multiple versions of the same English topic counted as different documents.
Location: Section 2 Dataset description

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The fact that English documents are longer than those in Yorùbá makes the task easier for Yorùbá, since documents are significantly shorter within the same topic or domain. We identified a subset of six documents that are strictly comparable in length and topic for English and Yorùbá, which allows us to make a fair comparison.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3 Experiments
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: The fact that English documents are longer than those in Yorùbá... We identified a subset of six documents that are strictly comparable in length and topic for English and Yorùbá...

- Evidence Text: Table 2 details the statistics of the data set. Our carefully curated selection contains 208 unique Yorùbá Wikipedia documents with an average word count of 430, and 356 unique questions. Only the questions are strictly comparable. English and Yorùbá documents are not comparable in number or length, but they are so in topic and domain.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 2.2 Dataset creation
  Limitations: Does not directly state the reason for the difference in document count
  Exact Quote: Table 2 details the statistics of the data set... English and Yorùbá documents are not comparable in number or length, but they are so in topic and domain.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The English documents outnumber Yorùbá documents mainly due to multiple versions of the same English topic counted as different documents.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on the dataset's statistics and the identification of comparable documents. However, the analysis could be strengthened by further exploring the content of the multiple English topic versions.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the provided dataset and might not be generalizable to other datasets or contexts.

Claim 6:
Statement: The fact that English documents are longer than those in Yorùbá makes the task easier for Yorùbá, since documents are significantly shorter within the same topic or domain.
Location: Section 3 Experiments

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The dataset was split into equal size of documents in each length bucket. We can see a drop in performance when the Yorùbá documents reach 1,500 words, which shows the challenges that current models face in long-context understanding of low-resource languages.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3, Figure 1
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: None

- Evidence Text: Table 2 details the statistics of the data set. Our carefully curated selection contains 208 unique Yorùbá Wikipedia documents with an average word count of 430, and 356 unique questions.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 2.2, Table 2
  Limitations: Only provides average word count, not direct comparison of document length
  Exact Quote: None

- Evidence Text: For a small portion of long-enough documents of comparable length between English and Yorùbá (only 4 documents that are over 900 words long), English performance demonstrates a significant edge (1.58X-2.56X), see Table 5.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3, Table 5
  Limitations: Only based on a small portion of documents
  Exact Quote: None

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The fact that English documents are longer than those in Yorùbá makes the task easier for Yorùbá, since documents are significantly shorter within the same topic or domain.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical data from the dataset, including the performance drop for longer Yorùbá documents and the significant difference in document length between English and Yorùbá. However, the analysis could be strengthened by considering more length buckets and evaluating the performance of more models.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific dataset and models used in the study. The generalizability of the findings to other low-resource languages and models is uncertain.
  Location: Section 3 Experiments

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3: Experiments
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Table 4 reports the results showing that Yorùbá consistently performs worse than English (e.g., losing 0.4 in Rouge-1).

- Evidence Text: Model performance changes with the length of the document, as shown in Figure 1. The dataset was split into equal size of documents in each length bucket. We can see a drop in performance when the Yorùbá documents reach 1,500 words, which shows the challenges that current models face in long-context understanding of low-resource languages.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3: Experiments
  Limitations: Only considers document length as a factor
  Exact Quote: Model performance changes with the length of the document, as shown in Figure 1.

- Evidence Text: For a small portion of long-enough documents of comparable length between English and Yorùbá (only 4 documents that are over 900 words long), English performance demonstrates a significant edge (1.58X-2.56X), see Table 5.
  Strength: weak
  Location: Section 3: Experiments
  Limitations: Only considers a small portion of documents
  Exact Quote: For a small portion of long-enough documents of comparable length between English and Yorùbá (only 4 documents that are over 900 words long), English performance demonstrates a significant edge (1.58X-2.56X), see Table 5.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The experiments show that the reading comprehension capabilities of current English LLMs do not extend to Yorùbá.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on multiple evaluation metrics (Rouge-1, Rouge-2, Rouge-L) and covers various aspects of the task, including document length. However, the small sample size of comparable documents (only 4) is a limitation.
  Limitations: Small sample size of comparable documents between English and Yorùbá, which might not be representative of the entire dataset.
  Location: Section 3 Experiments

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 8:
Statement: The model performance changes with the length of the document, with a drop in performance when the Yorùbá documents reach 1,500 words.
Location: Section 3 Experiments

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Figure 1 Impact of Document Length Buckets on Performance Scores for English (top) and Yorùbá (bottom) for GPT-4 outputs
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3 Experiments
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Model performance changes with the length of the document, as shown in Figure 1. The dataset was split into equal size of documents in each length bucket. We can see a drop in performance when the Yorùbá documents reach 1,500 words, which shows the challenges that current models face in long-context understanding of low-resource languages.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The model performance changes with the length of the document, with a drop in performance when the Yorùbá documents reach 1,500 words.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical data (model performance scores) and visualized through a clear and interpretable graph (Figure 1). However, the robustness could be further enhanced by including more data points, especially for the higher end of the document length spectrum, to confirm the trend's consistency.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the performance of the GPT-4 model and might not generalize to other models. Additionally, the dataset's size and the distribution of document lengths could influence the observed trend.
