--------------------------------------------------

Claim 24:
Statement: The authors found that the RAG-based GPT model still tends to excessively condense content and generate hallucinations.
Location: Case Study 3: A Comparison with GPT Extracted Statements

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: For instance, consider the sentence “Their restoration and rewetting is crucial to meet 1.5°C–2°C pathways by 2050” from the second statement generated by the RAG-based GPT model. In the cited section (i.e., IPCC WGIII Section 7.4), we find sentences such as “... both peatland protection and peatland restoration (Section 7.4.2.7) are needed to achieve a 2°C mitigation...” and “...peatlands, coastal wetlands, and forests are particularly important as most carbon lost from these ecosystems is irrecoverable through restoration by the 2050 timeline...”. However, there is insufficient evidence to justify summarizing these specific details into the broader statement provided by the model.
  Strength: strong

  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: For instance, consider the sentence “Their restoration and rewetting is crucial to meet 1.5°C–2°C pathways by 2050” from the second statement generated by the RAG-based GPT model.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors found that the RAG-based GPT model still tends to excessively condense content and generate hallucinations.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it provides a concrete example of the model's behavior, allowing for a clear evaluation of its performance. However, the generalizability of this finding to other statements generated by the model is uncertain.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to a single example and may not be representative of the model's overall performance. Further evaluation with a larger dataset would be necessary to confirm the authors' conclusion.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 25:
Statement: The authors found that only their statements contain the scientific publication information that the statement refers to.
Location: Case Study 3: A Comparison with GPT Extracted Statements

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors compared their statement extraction results with large language models (LLMs) and found that only their statements contain the scientific publication information that the statement refers to.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Case Study 3: A Comparison with ChatGPT generated Statement of ‘wetland restoration’
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Unlike our method, the zero-shot GPT model often produces statements that cite inaccurate IPCC sections... Overall, the IPCC reports emphasize the importance of wetland restoration as a nature-based solution for climate change mitigation and adaptation, offering multiple co-benefits for biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors concluded that their statements are more accurate and reliable compared to those generated by large language models (LLMs), specifically in containing scientific publication information.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a direct comparison between the authors' statements and those generated by LLMs. However, the sample size is limited to a single case study, which might not be representative of all possible scenarios.
  Limitations: The study only compared the authors' statements with those generated by LLMs, without considering other potential methods for statement extraction. Additionally, the evaluation of the statements' quality is subjective and based on the authors' expertise.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 26:
Statement: The authors found that their statements also face issues, as they are not comprehensive enough because they directly select sentences from the IPCC reports.
Location: Case Study 3: A Comparison with GPT Extracted Statements

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Thus, only our statements contain the scientific publication information that the statement refers to, e.g., "... Doughty et al., 2019; Leuven et al.,..." (cf. the third statement in Table 3). As mentioned in Case Study 2, such references provide important scientific evidence supporting the statements. Additionally, the GPT-generated statements lack uncertainty assessment information as we do. Confidence and likelihood levels are crucial for evaluating the validity and probability of the statements. On the other hand, our own generated statements also face issues: they are not comprehensive enough because we directly select sentences from the IPCC reports. For example, it is difficult for readers to fully understand the fourth statement "... wetland restoration has a technical potential of 0.3 (0.04–0.84) gtco2-eq yr –1 of which 0.1 (0.05–0.2) gtco2-eq yr –1 is available up to usd100 tco2–1.", that we generated, as it stands alone with no in-context information. Providing background information such as explanations of terms (e.g., “gtco2-eq”) may potentially enhance comprehension, which urges us to seek engagement with more climate experts in the future.
  Strength: strong
