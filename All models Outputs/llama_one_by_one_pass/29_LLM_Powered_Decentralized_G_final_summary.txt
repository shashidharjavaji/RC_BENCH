Location: Section 5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: In the two-agent scenario, LLM MemComm agents are able to distribute tasks more efficiently. On average, LLM MemComm agents collect a diamond in 121 steps, compared to 140 steps for a single agent, resulting in 13.6% fewer steps to achieve the goal, and 63% fewer steps compared to the LLM basic agent (Table 1).

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The introduction of the Structured Communication System (S-CS) allowed agents to efficiently manage resource collection by dynamically assigning roles during gameplay.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on quantitative measurements (number of steps) and demonstrates a clear improvement in efficiency. However, the robustness could be further enhanced by providing additional metrics, such as resource utilization or agent coordination quality.
  Limitations: The evidence is limited to the two-agent scenario, and it is unclear whether the S-CS would yield similar benefits in scenarios with more agents or different environmental conditions.
