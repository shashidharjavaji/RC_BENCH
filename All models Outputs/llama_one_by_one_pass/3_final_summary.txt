Claim 2:
Statement: The proposed evaluation technique based on text similarity can quantify the degree of uncertainty in model outputs.
Location: Section 3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We define a similarity function, fsim, to compute the similarity, S, between a given sentence, t, and a collection of reference sentences, U = {u1, u2,..., un}, endowed with uncertain meanings.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3: Evaluation Method
  Limitations: Assumes the availability of a comprehensive set of reference sentences with uncertain meanings
  Exact Quote: Whenever any Si surpasses a pre-determined threshold, we perceive the text t as encompassing uncertain meanings, thereby eliminating the need for manual evaluation of the response.

- Evidence Text: We tested various thresholds for filtering sentences with uncertain meanings and compared them to manually annotated sentences. A threshold of 0.75 produced the highest F1 score, balancing precision and the inclusion of other uncertain sentences.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Appendix A.2: Threshold ablation
  Limitations: Limited to the specific experiment and dataset used
  Exact Quote: 0.75 as the similarity threshold for subsequent experiments.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The proposed evaluation technique based on text similarity can effectively quantify the degree of uncertainty in model outputs.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a well-defined similarity function and a systematic evaluation of thresholds. However, the robustness could be further enhanced by exploring additional similarity metrics or evaluating the technique across a broader range of models and datasets.
  Limitations: The technique's effectiveness might be limited by the quality and diversity of the reference sentences. Additionally, the choice of threshold might need to be adjusted based on the specific application or model being evaluated.
