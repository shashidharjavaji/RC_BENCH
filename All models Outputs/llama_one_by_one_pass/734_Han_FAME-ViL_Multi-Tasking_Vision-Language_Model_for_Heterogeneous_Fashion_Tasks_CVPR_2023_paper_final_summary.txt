Claim 5:
Statement: The proposed multi-teacher distillation (MTD) based training strategy can implicitly regularize the gradients via knowledge distillation, without a costly need of monitoring the validation performance.
Location: Section 4.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: As shown in the group (III) of Tab. 4, the performance of IAS (L12) and IMTLG (L14) are significantly lower than that of our MTD (L9). In particular, IMTLG suffers from a severe negative transfer (-6.33%). There are two plausible reasons: (1) Relying on a heuristic strategy, IAS struggles in finding the optimal status over all tasks, despite the access to the validation performance. (2) IMTLG may experience over-fitting for the tasks with smaller training data (e.g., TGIR), which cannot be addressed by the idea of ensuring the final gradient direction to have the same impact on each task. On the contrary, our MTD can implicitly regularize the gradients via knowledge distillation, without a costly need of monitoring the validation performance.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: On the contrary, our MTD can implicitly regularize the gradients via knowledge distillation, without a costly need of monitoring the validation performance.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The proposed multi-teacher distillation (MTD) based training strategy can implicitly regularize the gradients via knowledge distillation, without a costly need of monitoring the validation performance.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a comprehensive comparison with other methods, and the results are consistent across different tasks. However, the analysis could be strengthened by providing more details on the implementation of MTD and the specific tasks used for evaluation.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific tasks and methods compared in the study. Further research is needed to generalize the findings to other tasks and methods.
  Location: Section 4.3

Claim 6:
Statement: The overall relative performance is positively correlated with the bottleneck dimension of the AdaptMLP in XAA and TSA.
Location: Section 4.4

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: As shown in the group (IV) of Tab. 4, it is evident that the overall relative performance is positively correlated with this bottleneck dimension. For example, 10% more parameters are needed for exchanging a relative performance gain of 1.4% (L18 vs. L9).
  Strength: strong

  Limitations: None

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The overall relative performance is positively correlated with the bottleneck dimension of the AdaptMLP in XAA and TSA.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from multiple experiments with varying bottleneck dimensions. However, the analysis is limited to the specific experiments and bottleneck dimensions tested, and may not generalize to other scenarios.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific experiments and bottleneck dimensions tested, and may not generalize to other scenarios. Additionally, the relationship between bottleneck dimension and relative performance may not be linear or consistent across all possible values.
