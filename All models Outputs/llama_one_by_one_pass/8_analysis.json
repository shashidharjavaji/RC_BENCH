                "justification_explanation": "The evidence provided in Figure 8 clearly shows that BM25 consistently outperforms Contriever across all data points, but the LM-supervised Contriever surpasses BM25's performance. This suggests that the LM-supervised training scheme effectively improves the retriever's performance, supporting the claim.",

However, the analysis could be further strengthened by evaluating the retrievers on additional datasets or tasks.",
