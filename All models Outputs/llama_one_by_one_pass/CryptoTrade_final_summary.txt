Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: CryptoTrade outperforms time-series baselines but not superior than traditional trading signals: Buy and Hold and SLMA.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on comprehensive experiments across multiple cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, and SOL) and market conditions (Bull, Sideways, and Bear). The use of multiple evaluation metrics (Return, Sharpe Ratio, Daily Return Mean, and Daily Return Std) provides a well-rounded assessment of CryptoTrade's performance. However, the reliance on a limited dataset and the lack of fine-tuning for the LLMs using the validation set may introduce some limitations to the robustness of the evidence.
  Limitations: Limited dataset, lack of fine-tuning for LLMs using the validation set, and potential overfitting to the training data.
