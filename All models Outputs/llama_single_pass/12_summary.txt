Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: DocPrompting consistently improves NL code models in two tasks, in two PLs, and across multiple strong base models.
Location: Section 5
Exact Quote: DocPrompting consistently improves NL code models in two tasks, in two PLs, and across multiple strong base models.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 1: Results on shell scripting, using a BM25 retriever with top-10 retrieved docs, on the test set of tldr.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.1
  Limitations: Limited to shell scripting task and tldr dataset
  Exact Quote: Table 1: Results on shell scripting, using a BM25 retriever with top-10 retrieved docs, on the test set of tldr.

- Evidence Text: Table 3: Results on CoNaLa, using a CodeT5 retriever with top-10 retrieved docs.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.2
  Limitations: Limited to CoNaLa dataset and Python programming task
  Exact Quote: Table 3: Results on CoNaLa, using a CodeT5 retriever with top-10 retrieved docs.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence from both tables demonstrates significant improvements in NL code generation tasks across different datasets and programming languages.
Key Limitations: Dataset and task limitations

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: DocPrompting allows models to generate calls to unseen functions by retrieving these functions' documentation and reading them at test time.
Location: Section 1
Exact Quote: DocPrompting allows models to generate calls to unseen functions by retrieving these functions' documentation and reading them at test time.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Figure 1: DocPrompting: given an NL intent n, the retriever retrieves a set of relevant documentation {d1, d2, d3} from a documentation pool D.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 1
  Limitations: High-level overview, lacks specific details
  Exact Quote: Figure 1: DocPrompting: given an NL intent n, the retriever retrieves a set of relevant documentation {d1, d2, d3} from a documentation pool D.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The figure provides a clear illustration of the DocPrompting process, but more detailed explanations are needed to fully understand the methodology.
Key Limitations: Lack of detailed methodology explanation

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: Retrieving documentation significantly increases the n-gram overlap recall between the input and the output, in tldr and CoNaLa.
Location: Section 6.1
Exact Quote: Retrieving documentation significantly increases the n-gram overlap recall between the input and the output, in tldr and CoNaLa.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 8: n-gram overlap between different contents (%).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6.1
  Limitations: Limited to n-gram overlap metric
  Exact Quote: Table 8: n-gram overlap between different contents (%).

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The table provides clear evidence of increased n-gram overlap recall, supporting the claim.
Key Limitations: Metric limitations
