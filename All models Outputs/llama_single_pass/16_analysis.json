EUREKA achieves human-level performance on a diverse suite of 29 open-sourced reinforcement learning (RL) environments, outperforming human-engineered rewards on 83% of tasks with an average normalized improvement of 52%. The algorithm's strength lies in its ability to learn dexterous manipulation tasks, such as pen spinning, and its applicability to advanced policy learning approaches.\n\n**Claims and Evidence:**\n\n1. **Claim:** EUREKA achieves human-level performance on a diverse suite of RL environments.\n\t* **Evidence:** Experimental results on 29 open-sourced RL environments, including 10 distinct robot morphologies, with EUREKA outperforming human-engineered rewards on 83% of tasks (Section 4.3).\n\t* **Evaluation:** Conclusion justified (True), Robustness: High, Justification: EUREKA's performance is consistently better than human-engineered rewards across various environments, Key Limitations: None, Confidence Level: High.\n\n2. **Claim:** EUREKA solves dexterous manipulation tasks, such as pen spinning, for the first time with a curriculum learning approach.\n\t* **Evidence:** Experimental results on the pen spinning task, where EUREKA fine-tunes a policy to successfully spin the pen for many cycles (Section 4.3, Figure 7).\n\t* **Evaluation:** Conclusion justified (True), Robustness: High, Justification: EUREKA's ability to learn complex manipulation skills is demonstrated through the pen spinning task, Key Limitations: Curriculum learning approach, Confidence Level: High.\n\n3. **Claim:** EUREKA enables a new gradient-free in-context learning approach to RL from human feedback (RLHF) that readily incorporates human reward initialization and textual feedback.\n\t* **Evidence:** Experimental results on EUREKA's ability to improve and benefit from human reward initialization (Section 4.4, Figure 8) and incorporate human reward reflection to modify rewards (Section 4.4).\n\t* **Evaluation:** Conclusion justified (True), Robustness: Medium, Justification: EUREKA's flexibility in incorporating human feedback is demonstrated, but the effectiveness of this approach may depend on the quality of human input, Key Limitations: Quality of human input, Confidence Level: Medium.\n\n**Methodology and Contributions:**\n\n* **Methodology:** EUREKA combines coding LLMs with in-context evolutionary search to generate human-level rewards.\n* **Contributions:**\n\t+ **Novelty:** EUREKA's approach to reward design is novel and distinct from existing methods.\n\t+ **Impact:** EUREKA's ability to achieve human-level performance and solve complex manipulation tasks has significant implications for RL research and applications.\n\t+ **Improvement:** EUREKA's performance surpasses human-engineered rewards in most tasks, demonstrating a substantial improvement in reward design.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work:**\n\n* **Limitations:**\n\t- **Dependence on LLM Quality:** EUREKA's performance may degrade with lower-quality LLMs (Section 4.3).\n\t- **Human Feedback Quality:** The effectiveness of EUREKA's RLHF approach may depend on the quality of human input.\n* **Future Work:**\n\t- **Exploring EUREKA's Applicability:** Investigating EUREKA's performance in various RL domains and tasks.\n\t- **Improving LLMs for Reward Design:** Enhancing LLMs to better support EUREKA's reward generation capabilities.",
