Claim 1:
Type: result/performance
Statement: LLMs have limited financial domain knowledge and insufficient mathematical capabilities for analyzing XBRL reports.
Location: Section 3.3 Findings
Exact Quote: Our analysis reveals two inherent limitations of LLMs for XBRL report analysis, which are difficult to address through internal mechanisms such as prompt engineering alone.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Results of motivating experiment (Figure 3) show LLMs' moderate proficiency in financial terminology but difficulties with specific XBRL report interpretations.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.2 Results
  Limitations: Limited to the specific experiment setup and LLMs used
  Exact Quote: We present questions directly to the evaluation models to examine the LLMsâ€™ capacity to analyze XBRL reports without any supplementary context.

- Evidence Text: Results of ablation study (Figure 8) demonstrate notable improvements over the baseline (without tool) but are inferior to the combined retriever-calculator approach.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.3 Ablation Study
  Limitations: Focused on the retriever's performance for numeric type query
  Exact Quote: The results shown in Fig. 8 demonstrate notable improvements over the baseline (without tool) but are inferior to the combined retriever-calculator approach.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim by demonstrating the LLMs' limitations in both financial domain knowledge and mathematical capabilities, which are addressed by the proposed enhancements.
Key Limitations: The experiments' focus on specific LLMs and tasks might not generalize to all scenarios

Claim 2:
Type: result/performance
Statement: Integrating a retriever and a financial calculator significantly enhances LLM performance in XBRL report analysis.
Location: Section 5.2 Results
Exact Quote: Our experiments reveal that integrating specialized tools significantly enhances LLM performance in XBRL report analysis.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Results (Figure 6) show substantial improvements across various XBRL analysis tasks, with the retriever boosting domain-related queries and the calculator enhancing numerical calculations.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.2 Results
  Limitations: Limited to the specific experiment setup and tools used
  Exact Quote: We utilize the same four datasets as in Section 3.1 Motivating Experiment.

- Evidence Text: The combined retriever-calculator approach consistently outperforms single-tool implementations across all tasks and models (Figure 7).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.2 Results
  Limitations: Focused on the combined approach's performance
  Exact Quote: Notably, combining both tools yields synergistic effects, addressing both the need for domain knowledge and the deficiency in the computational accuracy of financial analysis.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence strongly supports the claim by demonstrating the significant enhancements in LLM performance through the integration of specialized tools.
Key Limitations: The experiments' focus on specific tools and tasks might not generalize to all scenarios
