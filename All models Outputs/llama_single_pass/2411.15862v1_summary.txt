Claim 1:
Type: contribution/performance
Statement: LLMs do not think step-by-step in implicit reasoning.
Location: Abstract and Conclusion
Exact Quote: LLMs, despite they can often directly give the correct answer of a multi-step problem, especially when with a larger size, they are not really doing step-by-step reasoning (at least in arithmetic problems), unless adopting explicit CoT.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experimental results showing low accuracy in probing intermediate steps in implicit reasoning (Figures 2 and 3).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.2
  Limitations: Limited to arithmetic problems and a specific LLM model (Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct).
  Exact Quote: The results in Figure 2 and Figure 3 shows the accuracy of probing the intermediate result of each step when the problem is 3-step or 5-step.

- Evidence Text: Performance degradation in modified problems (Table 1).
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 2.3
  Limitations: Modification methods might not fully capture the essence of step-by-step reasoning.
  Exact Quote: From the results in Table 1, we can clearly see that, compare to the original problems, the modified problems significantly degrade the performance when using implicit reasoning.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence strongly supports the claim, showing both the inability to accurately probe intermediate steps and the performance drop in slightly modified problems, indicating a lack of true step-by-step reasoning in implicit CoT.
Key Limitations: Generalizability to other problem types and LLM models.

Claim 2:
Type: contribution/performance
Statement: Implicit reasoning in LLMs is less reliable and less robust than explicit CoT.
Location: Conclusion
Exact Quote: This finding remind us that there is no free lunch, that is, under current technological conditions, there may not be a perfect solution that can make LLMs output very few tokens while keeping the accuracy on solving complex problems.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Significant performance drop in modified problems using implicit reasoning (Table 1).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.3
  Limitations: Specific to the tested modifications and model.
  Exact Quote: From the results in Table 1, we can clearly see that, compare to the original problems, the modified problems significantly degrade the performance when using implicit reasoning.

- Evidence Text: Contrasting performance of implicit vs. explicit CoT in modified and original problems (Table 1).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.3
  Limitations: Limited to the specific experimental setup.
  Exact Quote: While the performance of explicit reasoning is always perfect, the modified problems significantly degrade the performance when using implicit reasoning.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence strongly supports the claim, demonstrating a clear performance gap between implicit and explicit CoT, especially under slight modifications, which underscores the reliability and robustness issue with implicit reasoning.
Key Limitations: Generalizability to other scenarios and models.
