Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: Fine-tuning LLMs on datasets consisting solely of problems and corresponding reference plans struggles to foster robust planning skills beyond in-distribution instances.
Location: Section 4.1
Exact Quote: Fine-tuning LLMs on datasets consisting solely of problems and corresponding reference plans struggles to foster robust planning skills beyond in-distribution instances.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The model achieved high performance across all domains in in-distribution tests, but showed a significant performance drop in the 'long' test set, particularly in the NP-hard BLOCKSWORLD domain.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: Limited to in-distribution and 'long' test sets
  Exact Quote: Table 1 presents the performance of our fine-tuned LLM on the vanilla corpus.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim by showing a significant performance drop in the 'long' test set, indicating the model's limitations in handling longer and more complex planning scenarios.
Key Limitations: Limited to in-distribution and 'long' test sets

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: RL emerges as the most effective strategy in this end-to-end paradigm, enhancing both the validity and executability rates on longer problems.
Location: Section 4.7
Exact Quote: RL emerges as the most effective strategy in this end-to-end paradigm, enhancing both the validity and executability rates on longer problems.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: RL boosted the validity rate on the 'long' test set from 34.8% to 41.5% and the executability rate from 42.3% to 53.6%.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 2, row 10
  Limitations: Limited to 'long' test set
  Exact Quote: Table 2 presents the performance of RL on the 'long' test set.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim by showing a significant improvement in both validity and executability rates on the 'long' test set.
Key Limitations: Limited to 'long' test set

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: performance
Statement: The model is able to identify errors in a high precision and recall rate, but fails to correct them effectively.
Location: Section 4.4
Exact Quote: The model is able to identify errors in a high precision and recall rate, but fails to correct them effectively.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The model achieved high precision (90.5%) and recall (99.2%) in identifying errors, but failed to correct them effectively in the BLOCKSWORLD problem instance.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Table 3
  Limitations: Limited to a single problem instance
  Exact Quote: Table 3 presents the precision and recall rates of the model in identifying errors.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence supports the claim by showing high precision and recall rates in identifying errors, but limited to a single problem instance.
Key Limitations: Limited to a single problem instance
