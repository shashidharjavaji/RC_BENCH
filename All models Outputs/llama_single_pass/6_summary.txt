Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: Retrieving nearest neighbors from data can be a substitute for training on it.
Location: Section 4.2
Exact Quote: Retrieving nearest neighbors from data can be a substitute for training on it.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 3 shows that, as expected, the model trained on 3B tokens dramatically outperforms the model trained on 100M tokens, improving perplexity from 19.59 to 15.17. However, adding nearest neighbors retrieval over those 3B examples to the model trained on 100M tokens improves perplexity from 19.59 to 13.73;
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Specific to the WIKI-3B dataset
  Exact Quote: Table 3 shows that, as expected, the model trained on 3B tokens dramatically outperforms the model trained on 100M tokens, improving perplexity from 19.59 to 15.17. However, adding nearest neighbors retrieval over those 3B examples to the model trained on 100M tokens improves perplexity from 19.59 to 13.73;

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim, showing that retrieving nearest neighbors can outperform training on the same data.
Key Limitations: Dataset specificity

Claim 3:
Type: contribution
Statement: kNN-LM allows a single model to be useful in multiple domains, by simply adding a datastore per domain.
Location: Section 4.3
Exact Quote: kNN-LM allows a single model to be useful in multiple domains, by simply adding a datastore per domain.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 4 shows that an in-domain LM on BOOKS has a relatively low perplexity (11.89), while a model trained on WIKI-3B performs poorly on the BOOKS domain (34.84 perplexity). Adding kNN search over BOOKS to the WIKI-3B model reduces perplexity by 14 points (to 20.47), demonstrating that kNN-LM allows a single model to be useful in multiple domains, by simply adding a datastore per domain.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Specific to the BOOKS and WIKI-3B datasets
  Exact Quote: Table 4 shows that an in-domain LM on BOOKS has a relatively low perplexity (11.89), while a model trained on WIKI-3B performs poorly on the BOOKS domain (34.84 perplexity). Adding kNN search over BOOKS to the WIKI-3B model reduces perplexity by 14 points (to 20.47), demonstrating that kNN-LM allows a single model to be useful in multiple domains, by simply adding a datastore per domain.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim, showing a significant improvement in perplexity when adding a domain-specific datastore.
Key Limitations: Dataset specificity
