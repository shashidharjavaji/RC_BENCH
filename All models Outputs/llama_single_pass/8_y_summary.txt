Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: Self-supervised multimodal opinion summarization framework called MultimodalSum
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: To use the abundant information contained in non-text data, we propose a self-supervised multimodal opinion summarization framework called MultimodalSum

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experimental results on Yelp and Amazon datasets
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6
  Limitations: Limited to specific datasets and domains
  Exact Quote: We demonstrate the superiority of MultimodalSum by conducting experiments on Yelp and Amazon datasets

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The framework's performance on two diverse datasets supports its effectiveness
Key Limitations: Dataset and domain limitations

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: Multimodal training pipeline resolves the heterogeneity of multimodal data
Location: Section 5
Exact Quote: To address the challenge, we propose a multimodal training pipeline

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experimental results showing improved performance with the pipeline
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 7.2
  Limitations: Limited to the specific pipeline design
  Exact Quote: For analyzing the model training pipeline, we removed text modality or/and other modalities pretraining from the pipeline

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The pipeline's effectiveness is demonstrated through ablation studies
Key Limitations: Pipeline design limitations

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: performance
Statement: MultimodalSum outperforms unimodal frameworks and baseline models in opinion summarization
Location: Section 7.1.1
Exact Quote: MultimodalSum showed superior results compared with extractive and abstractive baselines for both token-level and document-level measures

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: ROUGE and BERT-score results on Yelp and Amazon datasets
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 2
  Limitations: Limited to specific evaluation metrics
  Exact Quote: MultimodalSum showed superior results compared with extractive and abstractive baselines for both token-level and document-level measures

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The framework's superior performance is supported by both token-level and document-level evaluation metrics
Key Limitations: Evaluation metric limitations
