Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: Integrated gradients satisfy Sensitivity(a) and Implementation Invariance.
Location: Section 3
Exact Quote: Integrated gradients satisfy Sensitivity(a) because Completeness implies Sensitivity(a) and is thus a strengthening of the Sensitivity(a) axiom.

Evidence:

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3
  Limitations: Assumes differentiability of the function F
  Exact Quote: If F : R[n] → R is differentiable almost everywhere then Σ[n]i=1[IntegratedGrads]i[(x) = F(x) − F(x[′])

Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The formal proof provides a strong mathematical basis for the claim.
Key Limitations: Assumption of differentiability

Exact Quote: Proposition 2. (Theorem 1 (Friedman, 2004)) Path methods are the only attribution methods that always satisfy Implementation Invariance, Sensitivity(b), Linearity, and Completeness.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Theorem 1 (Friedman, 2004)

Exact Quote: IntegratedGrads[approx]i (x) ::= (xi − x[′]i) × ∑[m]k=1 ∂F (x[′] + k/m × (x − x[′])) / m

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Riemann approximation
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: Approximation error depends on the number of steps (m)
  Exact Quote: IntegratedGrads[approx]i (x) ::= (xi − x[′]i) × ∑[m]k=1 ∂F (x[′] + k/m × (x − x[′])) / m
