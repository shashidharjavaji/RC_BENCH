**Claims and Evaluations:**

1. **Claim:** Combining tabular data from financial semi-structured documents with text transcripts and audio recordings improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12%.
	* **Evaluation:** Supported by strong evidence from Tables 3 and 4, showing significant improvements across multiple datasets. (Confidence Level: High)
2. **Claim:** The proposed approach reduces gender bias learned by audio-based neural networks by over 30%.
	* **Evaluation:** Supported by strong evidence from Table 6, demonstrating a significant reduction in gender bias across multiple modalities and datasets. (Confidence Level: High)
