      - **Location:** Section 2.1
      - **Exact Quote:** "Despite the availability of numerous benchmarks for language models, they primarily focus on evaluating models on closed-ended questions with short responses."
    - **Evidence Text:** "Current benchmarks mostly fall into three categories: core-knowledge, instruction-following, and conversational benchmarks, which do not adequately assess human preferences in open-ended tasks."
      - **Strength:** Strong
      - **Limitations:** None
      - **Location:** Section 2.1
      - **Exact Quote:** "While largely overlooked by existing LLM benchmarks, human preferences serve as a direct measure of a chatbotâ€™s utility in open-ended, multi-turn human-AI interactions."
*   **Evaluation:**
    - **Conclusion Justified:** True
    - **Robustness:** High
    - **Justification:** The claim is supported by the explanation of the limitations of existing benchmarks and the importance of human preferences in evaluating chatbots.
    - **Key Limitations:** Limited scope of existing benchmarks
    - **Confidence Level:** High

**Claim 2:**
*   **Claim ID:** 2
*   **Claim:**
    + **Text:** "Using strong LLMs as judges to evaluate chatbots on more open-ended questions can mitigate the challenges in evaluating human preferences."
    + **Type:** Methodology
    + **Location:** Abstract
    + **Exact Quote:** "To address this, we explore using strong LLMs as judges to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions."

    - **Evidence Text:** "We introduce two benchmarks with human ratings as the primary evaluation metric: MT-bench and Chatbot Arena."
      - **Strength:** Strong
      - **Limitations:** None
      - **Location:** Section 1
      - **Exact Quote:** "We then verify the agreement between LLM judges and human preferences by introducing two benchmarks: MT-bench, a multi-turn question set; and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform."
    - **Evidence Text:** "Our results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans."
      - **Strength:** Very Strong
      - **Limitations:** None
      - **Location:** Section 4.2
      - **Exact Quote:** "Our results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans."
*   **Evaluation:**
    - **Conclusion Justified:** True
    - **Robustness:** Very High
    - **Justification:** The claim is strongly supported by the introduction of new benchmarks and the high agreement rate between LLM judges and human preferences.
    - **Key Limitations:** None
    - **Confidence Level:** Very High

**Claim 3:**
*   **Claim ID:** 3
*   **Claim:**
    + **Text:** "LLM-as-a-judge has several limitations, including position bias, verbosity bias, self-enhancement bias, and limited reasoning ability."
    + **Type:** Methodology
    + **Location:** Section 3.3
    + **Exact Quote:** "We identify certain biases and limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge approach, including position bias, verbosity bias, self-enhancement bias, and limited reasoning ability."
*   **Evidence:**
    - **Evidence Text:** "Position bias is when an LLM exhibits a propensity to favor certain positions over others, as seen in Table 2."
      - **Strength:** Moderate
      - **Limitations:** Limited generalizability
      - **Location:** Section 3.3
      - **Exact Quote:** "Position bias is when an LLM exhibits a propensity to favor certain positions over others."
    - **Evidence Text:** "Verbosity bias is when an LLM favors longer, verbose responses, even if they are not as clear, high-quality, or accurate as shorter alternatives, as shown in Table 3."
      - **Strength:** Moderate
      - **Limitations:** Limited scope
      - **Location:** Section 3.3
      - **Exact Quote:** "Verbosity bias is when an LLM favors longer, verbose responses, even if they are not as clear, high-quality, or accurate as shorter alternatives."
    - **Evidence Text:** "Limited reasoning ability is a limitation in grading math and reasoning questions, as seen in Figure 13."
      - **Strength:** Strong
      - **Limitations:** Significant limitation
      - **Location:** Section 3.3
      - **Exact Quote:** "Limited capability in grading math and reasoning questions."
*   **Evaluation:**
    - **Conclusion Justified:** True
    - **Robustness:** High
    - **Justification:** The claim is supported by the explanation of various biases and limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge approach.
