**Analysis**

**Claim 1:**
*   **Claim ID:** 1
*   **Claim:**
    + **Text:** "A Panel of LLM Evaluators (PoLL) composed of smaller models is an effective method for evaluating LLM performance, reducing intra-model bias, latency, and cost."
    + **Type:** Methodology
    + **Location:** Section 5 Conclusions and Limitations
    + **Exact Quote:** "In this paper, we showed how a Panel of LLM Evaluators composed of smaller models is not only an effective method for evaluating LLM performance, but also reduces intra-model bias, latency, and cost."
*   **Evidence:**
    - **Evidence 1:**
      - **Evidence Text:** "Across three distinct judge settings and spanning six different datasets, we find that using a PoLL composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive."
      - **Strength:** Strong
      - **Limitations:** Limited to the specific datasets and judge settings evaluated
      - **Location:** Section 4 Results
      - **Exact Quote:** "Across three distinct judge settings and spanning six different datasets, we find that using a PoLL composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive."
    - **Evidence 2:**
      - **Evidence Text:** "The benefits of PoLL are bolstered by the finding that there is not a single ’best’ judge across all settings, while PoLL performs well consistently."
      - **Strength:** Moderate
      - **Limitations:** Based on the evaluated settings and models
      - **Location:** Section 5 Conclusions and Limitations
      - **Exact Quote:** "The benefits of PoLL are bolstered by the finding that there is not a single ’best’ judge across all settings, while PoLL performs well consistently."
*   **Evaluation:**
    - **Conclusion Justified:** True
    - **Robustness:** High
    - **Justification:** The evidence supports the claim by demonstrating the effectiveness and advantages of using a PoLL in evaluating LLM performance across various settings.
    - **Key Limitations:** The evaluation is limited to the specific datasets and judge settings.
    - **Confidence Level:** High

**Claim 2:**
*   **Claim ID:** 2
*   **Claim:**
    + **Text:** "Using a single large model like GPT-4 as an evaluator has been shown to introduce intra-model bias and is costly and slow."
    + **Type:** Methodology
    + **Location:** Section 1 Introduction
    + **Exact Quote:** "While this method has grown in popularity, it is costly, has been shown to introduce intra-model bias, and in this work, we find that very large models are often unnecessary."
*   **Evidence:**
    - **Evidence 1:**
      - **Evidence Text:** "GPT-4 is one of the weaker evaluators on the single-hop QA task setup, with a lower Cohen’s κ correlation with human judgements compared to other models and the PoLL."
      - **Strength:** Moderate
      - **Limitations:** Limited to the single-hop QA task setup
      - **Location:** Table 1
      - **Exact Quote:** "We see that overall, PoLL has the strongest correlation across various tasks, while GPT-4 is one of the weaker evaluators on this particular task setup."
    - **Evidence 2:**
      - **Evidence Text:** "Running a single large model like GPT-4 is seven to eight times more expensive than running a PoLL composed of smaller models."
      - **Strength:** Strong
      - **Limitations:** Based on the cost comparison provided
      - **Location:** Section 4.5 Cost and Latency
      - **Exact Quote:** "At the time of writing, the cost of running our specific instance of PoLL is $1.25/input + $4.25/output, whereas the cost of running GPT-4 Turbo is $10/input + $30/output."
*   **Evaluation:**
    - **Conclusion Justified:** True
    - **Robustness:** High
    - **Justification:** The evidence supports the claim by highlighting the drawbacks of using a single large model as an evaluator, including bias and cost.
    - **Key Limitations:** The evaluation is limited to the specific task setup and cost comparison.
    - **Confidence Level:** High

**Claim 3:**
*   **Claim ID:** 3
*   **Claim:**
    + **Text:** "The Panel of LLM Evaluators (PoLL) correlates better with human judgements compared to a single large judge like GPT-4, particularly at the top of the ranked list."
    + **Type:** Performance
    + **Location:** Section 4.2 Rank Correlation on Chatbot Arena
    + **Exact Quote:** "We find that PoLL is best correlated with the gold rankings, particularly at the top of the ranked list."
*   **Evidence:**
    - **Evidence 1:**
      - **Evidence Text:** "Pearson and Kendall-Tau correlations between different judge models as compared to the rankings produced by the Chatbot Arena overall leaderboard show that PoLL has the highest correlation."
      - **Strength:** Strong
      - **Limitations:** Limited to the Chatbot Arena Hard evaluation
      - **Location:** Table 2
      - **Exact Quote:** "We calculate both Kendall Tau and Pearson Correlation of the ranked list produced by each of the judge methods with respect to this ground truth ranking."
    - **Evidence 2:**
      - **Evidence Text:** "Figure 2 shows that PoLL rankings correlate better with the ground truth, particularly at the top of the ranked list, compared to GPT-4."
      - **Strength:** Strong
      - **Limitations:** Based on the visual representation
      - **Location:** Figure 2
      - **Exact Quote:** "The ’gold’ ranking appears on the diagonal and represents the rankings from the original Chatbot Arena ELO."
*   **Evaluation:**
    - **Conclusion Justified:** True
    - **Robustness:** High
    - **Justification:** The evidence supports the claim by demonstrating the superior correlation of PoLL with human judgements in the Chatbot Arena Hard evaluation.
    - **Key Limitations:** The evaluation is limited to the Chatbot Arena Hard setting.
    - **Confidence Level:** High
