**Authors:** Wenting Zhao, Alexander M. Rush, Tanya Goyal

**Analysis:**

### Claim 1: Open community-driven platforms like Chatbot Arena are widely accepted as trustworthy benchmarks for LLM performance.

*   **Claim:**
    *   **Text:** "Open community-driven platforms like Chatbot Arena have gained a reputation as one of the most trustworthy publicly available benchmarks for LLM performance."
    *   **Type:** Contribution
    *   **Location:** Abstract
    *   **Exact Quote:** "Open community-driven platforms like Chatbot Arena have gained a reputation as one of the most trustworthy publicly available benchmarks for LLM performance."
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Evidence Text:** "2,011,939 pairwise preference judgments collected by Chatbot Arena as of October 6, 2024"
    *   **Strength:** Moderate (large dataset, but lacks diversity and representativeness information)
    *   **Limitations:** Dataset size and collection date might not reflect the current state of LLM performance.
    *   **Location:** Section 1, Introduction
    *   **Exact Quote:** "As of October 6, 2024, Chatbot Arena has collected 2,011,939 pairwise preference judgments."
*   **Evaluation:**
    *   **Conclusion Justified:** True
    *   **Robustness:** Medium (dependent on the dataset's representativeness and the platform's continued usage)
    *   **Justification:** The large dataset supports the claim, but its limitations (size, date) might affect the conclusion's robustness.
    *   **Key Limitations:** Dataset representativeness and collection date.
    *   **Confidence Level:** Medium

### Claim 2: Only 10% of poor-quality annotations can change the leaderboard rankings of 2/3 models by 5 places.

*   **Claim:**
    *   **Text:** "Only 10% of poor-quality annotations can change the leaderboard rankings of 2/3 models by 5 places."
    *   **Type:** Result
    *   **Location:** Section 3.1, Apathetic Voting
    *   **Exact Quote:** "We find that only 10% of apathetic votes in the dataset can change the leaderboard rankings of 2/3 models by 5 places."
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Evidence Text:** Table 1, showing the change in leaderboard rankings for 3 test models based on different percentages of arbitrary votes.
    *   **Strength:** Strong (experimental results with clear, quantifiable outcomes)
    *   **Limitations:** Limited to the specific models and dataset used in the experiment.
    *   **Location:** Section 3.1, Apathetic Voting
    *   **Exact Quote:** Table 1.
*   **Evaluation:**
    *   **Conclusion Justified:** True
    *   **Robustness:** High (clear, quantifiable experimental results)
    *   **Justification:** The experimental results strongly support the claim, with minimal limitations.
    *   **Key Limitations:** Generalizability to other models and datasets.
    *   **Confidence Level:** High

### Claim 3: Adversarial attacks can substantially change leaderboard rankings if adversaries contribute 10% of the votes.

*   **Claim:**
    *   **Text:** "Adversarial attacks can substantially change leaderboard rankings if adversaries contribute 10% of the votes."
    *   **Type:** Result
    *   **Location:** Section 3.2, Adversarial Voting
    *   **Exact Quote:** "Across all models, we show that adversarial attacks can substantially change leaderboard rankings if adversaries get to contribute 10% votes for their model."
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Evidence Text:** Table 2, showing the change in leaderboard rankings for 3 test models based on different percentages of adversarial votes.
    *   **Strength:** Strong (experimental results with clear, quantifiable outcomes)
    *   **Limitations:** Limited to the specific attack methodology and models used in the experiment.
    *   **Location:** Section 3.2, Adversarial Voting
    *   **Exact Quote:** Table 2.
*   **Evaluation:**
    *   **Conclusion Justified:** True
    *   **Robustness:** High (clear, quantifiable experimental results)
    *   **Justification:** The experimental results strongly support the claim, with minimal limitations.
    *   **Key Limitations:** Generalizability to other attack methodologies and models.
    *   **Confidence Level:** High

### Claim 4: Traditional approaches like filtering out low-quality users/annotations using inter-annotator agreement may not be viable for open-ended queries.

*   **Claim:**
    *   **Text:** "Traditional approaches like filtering out low-quality users/annotations using inter-annotator agreement may not be viable for open-ended queries."
    *   **Type:** Contribution
    *   **Location:** Section 3.3, Arbitrary Voting
    *   **Exact Quote:** "More concerningly, the results highlight that traditional approaches like filtering out low-quality users/annotations using inter-annotator agreement may not be a viable strategy for open-ended queries as it is difficult to disentangle between of low inter-annotator agreement due to bad annotation (apathetic votes) or inherent subjectivity."
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Evidence Text:** Table 4, showing the low inter-annotator agreement on different evaluation axes for open-ended questions.
    *   **Strength:** Moderate (based on a small-scale annotation study)
    *   **Limitations:** Limited to the specific study and evaluation axes used.
    *   **Location:** Section 3.3, Arbitrary Voting
    *   **Exact Quote:** Table 4.
*   **Evaluation:**
    *   **Conclusion Justified:** True
    *   **Robustness:** Medium (dependent on the study's representativeness and generalizability)
    *   **Justification:** The study's results support the claim, but with notable limitations.
    *   **Key Limitations:** Study size and evaluation axes.
    *   **Confidence Level:** Medium
