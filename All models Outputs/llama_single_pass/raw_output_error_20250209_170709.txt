**Analysis of the Research Paper**

**Claim 1: Larger models are well-calibrated on diverse multiple choice questions**

*   **Claim Text:** "We show that when multiple choice problems are formatted in this way... our largest models tend to produce a well-calibrated probability distribution among the available options."
*   **Claim Type:** Performance
*   **Location:** Section 2
*   **Exact Quote:** "We show that when multiple choice problems are formatted in this way... our largest models tend to produce a well-calibrated probability distribution among the available options."
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Evidence Text:** Figure 4 (Calibration chart for all multiple choice BIG Bench tasks)
    *   **Strength:** Strong
    *   **Limitations:** Assumes the model sees the answer choices before making a choice
    *   **Location:** Figure 4
    *   **Exact Quote:** N/A
*   **Evaluation:**
    *   **Conclusion Justified:** True
    *   **Robustness:** High

    *   **Key Limitations:** Model sees answer choices before making a choice
    *   **Confidence Level:** High

**Claim 2: Replacing an option with 'none of the above' harms performance and calibration**

*   **Claim Text:** "We found that this procedure degraded performance very significantly on evaluations; results for MMLU are shown in Figure 36 in the appendix. Furthermore, adding 'none of the above' also harms calibration..."
*   **Claim Type:** Performance
*   **Location:** Section 3.1
*   **Exact Quote:** "We found that this procedure degraded performance very significantly on evaluations; results for MMLU are shown in Figure 36 in the appendix. Furthermore, adding 'none of the above' also harms calibration..."
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Evidence Text:** Figure 7 (MMLU Accuracy with None of the Above) and Figure 36 (appendix)
    *   **Strength:** Strong
    *   **Limitations:** Specific to MMLU evaluation
    *   **Location:** Figure 7 and Figure 36 (appendix)
    *   **Exact Quote:** N/A
*   **Evaluation:**
    *   **Conclusion Justified:** True
    *   **Robustness:** High
    *   **Justification:** The evidence strongly supports the claim, as the figures demonstrate significant degradation in performance and calibration.
    *   **Key Limitations:** Specific to MMLU evaluation
    *   **Confidence Level:** High

**Claim 3: Models can self-evaluate whether their own samples are True or False**

*   **Claim Text:** "We apply this approach to model-generated answers from TriviaQA, Lambada, the Codex HumanEval, GSM8k, and basic arithmetic problems."
*   **Claim Type:** Methodology
*   **Location:** Section 4
*   **Exact Quote:** "We apply this approach to model-generated answers from TriviaQA, Lambada, the Codex HumanEval, GSM8k, and basic arithmetic problems."
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Evidence Text:** Figure 1 (Summary histogram and comparisons) and Figure 10 (Lambada: 52B Self-Evaluation with Comparison Examples)
    *   **Strength:** Moderate
    *   **Limitations:** Assumes the model's ability to evaluate its own samples
    *   **Location:** Figure 1 and Figure 10
    *   **Exact Quote:** N/A
*   **Evaluation:**
    *   **Conclusion Justified:** True
    *   **Robustness:** Medium
    *   **Justification:** The evidence supports the claim, as the figures demonstrate the model's ability to self-evaluate its own samples.
    *   **Key Limitations:** Assumes the model's ability to evaluate its own samples
    *   **Confidence Level:** Medium

**Claim 4: Training models to predict whether they can answer questions correctly (P(IK))**

*   **Claim Text:** "We train models to predict whether they know the answer to any given free-form question, denoting the probability they assign as 'P(IK)'."
*   **Claim Type:** Methodology
*   **Location:** Section 5
*   **Exact Quote:** "We train models to predict whether they know the answer to any given free-form question, denoting the probability they assign as 'P(IK)'."
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Evidence Text:** Figure 12 (Testing a 52B classifier on a held-out set of TriviaQA questions) and Figure 16 (Generalization of P(IK))
    *   **Strength:** Strong
    *   **Limitations:** Assumes the model's ability to predict P(IK)
    *   **Location:** Figure 12 and Figure 16
    *   **Exact Quote:** N/A
*   **Evaluation:**
    *   **Conclusion Justified:** True
    *   **Robustness:** High
    *   **Justification:** The evidence strongly supports the claim, as the figures demonstrate the model's ability to predict P(IK).
