    "raw_claims": "Based on the provided paper text, here's a summary of the key points and findings:\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning without Prompting**:\n   - The paper explores whether large language models (LLMs) can reason effectively without prompting.\n   - The authors find that LLMs can generate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths by altering the decoding process.\n   - This approach bypasses the need for manual prompt engineering and allows for a more truthful assessment of the model's intrinsic reasoning abilities.\n\n2. **CoT-Decoding**:\n   - The authors propose a method called CoT-decoding, which involves considering alternative top-\ud835\udc58 tokens at the first decoding step.\n   - This method can reliably extract CoT paths and improve the model's reasoning performance.\n\n3. **Empirical Studies**:\n   - The authors conduct extensive empirical studies on various reasoning benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of CoT-decoding.\n   - They show that CoT-decoding can significantly improve the model's reasoning performance across different tasks and model families.\n\n4. **Comparison with Other Methods**:\n   - The authors compare CoT-decoding with other decoding strategies such as greedy decoding, temperature sampling, top-\ud835\udc58 sampling, and nucleus sampling.\n   - They find that CoT-decoding is the only decoding strategy that effectively improves the model's reasoning performance.\n\n5. **Intrinsic Reasoning Abilities**:\n   - The authors explore the model's intrinsic reasoning abilities by varying the difficulty levels of synthetic tasks.\n   - They find that the presence of correct CoT paths depends on the task difficulty levels and correlates with task prominence in the pre-training distribution.\n\n6. **Combining CoT-Decoding with CoT-Prompting**:\n   - The authors show that CoT-decoding can be easily combined with CoT-prompting to further boost the reasoning performance.\n   - They find that combining CoT-decoding with CoT-prompting yields even larger reasoning gains over multiple language models.\n\n### Findings:\n\n1. **Effective Reasoning without Prompting**:\n   - LLMs can generate CoT reasoning paths by altering the decoding process, bypassing the need for manual prompt engineering.\n   - This approach allows for a more truthful assessment of the model's intrinsic reasoning abilities.\n\n2. **Improved Reasoning Performance**:\n   - CoT-decoding can reliably extract CoT paths and improve the model's reasoning performance across different tasks and model families.\n   - The authors demonstrate significant accuracy gains over greedy decoding and other decoding strategies.\n\n3. **Intrinsic Reasoning Abilities**:\n   - The presence of correct CoT paths depends on the task difficulty levels and correlates with task prominence in the pre-training distribution.\n   - The authors find that the model's intrinsic reasoning abilities vary depending on the task difficulty levels.\n\n4. **Combining CoT-Decoding with CoT-Prompting**:\n   - Combining CoT-decoding with CoT-prompting yields even larger reasoning gains over multiple language models.\n   - The authors show that this combination can further improve the model's reasoning performance.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe paper presents a novel approach to eliciting chain-of-thought reasoning from large language models without the need for manual prompt engineering. The authors demonstrate that CoT-decoding can reliably extract CoT paths and improve the model's reasoning performance across different tasks and model families. They also show that combining CoT-decoding with CoT-prompting can further boost the reasoning performance. The findings highlight the importance of considering alternative decoding paths and the model's intrinsic reasoning abilities in assessing the model's performance.",
