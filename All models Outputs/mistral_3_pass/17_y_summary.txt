=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: We show that combining tabular data from financial semi-structured documents with text transcripts and audio recordings improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12% along with reduction in gender bias learned by audio-based neural networks by over 30%.
Location: Abstract
Type: Major
Quote: We show that combining tabular data from financial semi-structured documents with text transcripts and audio recordings improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12% along with reduction in gender bias learned by audio-based neural networks by over 30%.

Evidence:
- We show that combining tabular data from financial semi-structured documents with text transcripts and audio recordings improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12% along with reduction in gender bias learned by audio-based neural networks by over 30%.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Abstract

Claim 2:
Statement: We demonstrate that supplementing existing conference calls transcripts with the tabular financial data substantially reduces the unintended gender bias in financial prediction tasks and offers a robust and unbiased alternative to gender-sensitive audio features in cases where under-representation of women speakers induces unneeded correlations in model predictions.
