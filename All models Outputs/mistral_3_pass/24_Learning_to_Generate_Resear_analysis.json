    "raw_claims": "The provided text is a research paper abstract and introduction, detailing the methodology and objectives of a study on generating research ideas using large language models (LLMs). The paper introduces a novel framework that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and controllable reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the generation of research ideas across key metrics such as novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness.\n\nThe paper highlights the limitations of current approaches that rely on prompting-based pre-trained models, which limit their ability to optimize generated content effectively. The proposed framework aims to address these limitations by employing a two-stage approach: SFT and controllable RL. In the SFT stage, the model learns foundational patterns from pairs of research papers and follow-up ideas. In the RL stage, multidimensional reward modeling, guided by fine-grained feedback, evaluates and optimizes the generated ideas across key metrics. Dimensional controllers enable dynamic adjustment of generation, while a sentence-level decoder ensures context-aware emphasis during inference.\n\nThe paper also discusses related work in the field of NLP for scientific discovery, highlighting the advancements in LLMs and their potential applications in research ideation. It mentions various approaches to enhance idea generation, such as iterative novelty boosting, multi-agent collaboration, and multi-module retrieval and revision.\n\nThe methodology section outlines the proposed framework, including the data collection process, supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and multi-dimensional reward augmented controllable reinforcement learning. The paper also describes the decoding strategies used to dynamically adjust the generation style during inference.\n\nThe evaluation section presents the results of the experiments conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The paper compares the performance of different control strategies applied to the LLaMA2-RLHF model, including targeted controls for novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness. The results show that the dynamic decoding strategy, which combines all three controllers, achieves the highest overall score and demonstrates statistically significant improvements across all metrics.\n\nThe paper concludes by summarizing the contributions and highlighting the importance of reinforcement learning and dynamic control in tailoring model behavior to complex requirements. It also emphasizes the trade-offs inherent in single-metric optimizations and the need for a balanced approach to research ideation.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a comprehensive study on generating research ideas using LLMs, highlighting the potential of reinforcement learning and dynamic control in optimizing the quality and effectiveness of generated ideas.",
