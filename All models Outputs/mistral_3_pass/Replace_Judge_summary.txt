=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: Using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL) composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.
Location: Abstract
Type: Contribution
Quote: Using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL) composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.

Evidence:
- Using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL) composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.5
  Limitations: None
  Quote: At the time of writing, the cost of running our specific instance of PoLL is $1.25/input + $4.25/output, whereas the cost of running GPT-4 Turbo is $10/input + $30/output. Depending on the ratio of input-to-output tokens in a given task, running the entire three model PoLL is seven to eight times less expensive than running a single GPT-4 judge.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: The claim is based on empirical data from experiments across multiple datasets and settings, but the specific cost and performance metrics are not detailed in the paper.
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: We propose to evaluate LLM generations using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL) drawn from different model families rather than a single large judge.
Location: Section 2
Type: Contribution
Quote: We propose to evaluate LLM generations using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL) drawn from different model families rather than a single large judge.

Evidence:
- We propose to evaluate LLM generations using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL) drawn from different model families rather than a single large judge.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2
  Limitations: None
  Quote: To address this, we instead propose to score answer correctness based not on a single judge, but instead on a panel composed of multiple evaluator models.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: The claim is based on the proposed method and its implementation, but the effectiveness of the method in different scenarios is not fully explored.
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: Using an instantiation of PoLL correlates better with human judgements compared to a single large judge (GPT-4), while being over seven times cheaper.

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: None
  Quote: Overall, PoLL has the strongest correlation across various tasks, while GPT-4 is one of the weaker evaluators on this particular task setup.

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: In some scenarios, GPT-4 is a relatively weak judge, exhibiting high variance with minor changes to the prompt.
Location: Section 4.3
Type: Contribution
Quote: In some scenarios, GPT-4 is a relatively weak judge, exhibiting high variance with minor changes to the prompt.

Evidence:
- In some scenarios, GPT-4 is a relatively weak judge, exhibiting high variance with minor changes to the prompt.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: None
  Quote: We hypothesize that may be because GPT-4 is over-reasoning and injecting too much background knowledge into determining the correctness of an answer rather than simply aligning the gold reference with the generation.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: The claim is based on empirical data from experiments across multiple datasets and settings, but the specific cost and performance metrics are not detailed in the paper.
Confidence: medium

Location: Section 4.4
Type: Contribution
Quote: Intra-model scoring bias is reduced by pooling judgements across a panel of heterogeneous evaluator models.

Evidence:

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4
  Limitations: None
  Quote: We observe that overall, PoLL has the smallest spread in scores, with a standard deviation of 2.2, compared to EM and individual judges.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: The claim is based on empirical data from experiments across multiple datasets and settings, but the specific cost and performance metrics are not detailed in the paper.

Claim 7:
Statement: PoLL rankings correlate better with the ground truth, particularly at the top of the ranked list.
Location: Section 4.2

Evidence:
- PoLL rankings correlate better with the ground truth, particularly at the top of the ranked list.

Claim 8:

  Quote: The benefits of PoLL are bolstered by the finding that there is not a single ’best’ judge across all settings, while PoLL performs well consistently.
