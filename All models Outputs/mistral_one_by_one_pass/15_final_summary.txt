Claim 3:
Statement: The authors propose a method to sift through the top-ùëò decoding paths, which they refer to as CoT-decoding, thereby isolating the most reliable paths for model output.

Claim 5:
Statement: The authors show that LLMs indeed struggle with reasoning when relying solely on greedily decoded paths.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 6:
Statement: The authors observe that LLMs can generate CoT paths that simulate the process step-by-step, but it can easily lose track of the states, especially when the task complexity increases.
