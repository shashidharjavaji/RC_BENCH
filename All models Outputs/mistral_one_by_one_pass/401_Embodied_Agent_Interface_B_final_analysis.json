As shown in Fig 3 in the main paper, trajectory runtime errors are common (41.2%), with a large portion of missing step (15.5%) and additional step (16.2%) errors, often due to overlooking preconditions. For instance, LLMs may ignore the agent\u2019s sitting or lying state and fail to include a standup action before executing other actions. They sometimes also fail to understand the need to open a closed object before fetching items from inside. Additional step errors frequently occur when LLMs output actions for previously achieved goals.",
