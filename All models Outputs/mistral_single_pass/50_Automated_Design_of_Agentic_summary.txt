Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: The history of machine learning reveals a recurring theme: manually created artifacts become replaced by learned, more efficient solutions over time as we get more compute and data.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: For example, the current best-performing CNN models come from Neural Architecture Search instead of manual design; in LLM alignment, learned loss functions outperform most hand-designed ones such as DPO; The AI Scientist demonstrates an automated research pipeline, including the development of novel ML algorithms; and an endless number of robotics learning environments can be automatically generated in works like OMNI-EPIC, which demonstrate surprising creativity in generated environments and allow more efficient environment creation than the manual approach.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: Limited to specific examples and does not cover all scenarios.
