Claim 5:
Type: result
Statement: The ensemble structure involving multiple agent groups achieves superior performance in investment research tasks, achieving target price prediction with 2.35% avg. diff. and 66.7% accuracy in buy or not decision-making, surpassing all other agent architectures.
Location: Introduction
