     - **Confidence Level:** Medium

3. **Claim 3: MindMap is robust to mismatched retrieval knowledge**
   - **Type:** Performance
   - **Location:** Section 4.4.2
   - **Exact Quote:** "In Table 6, our method (MindMap) demonstrates superior accuracy compared to various baselines, affirming its effectiveness over document retrieval prompting techniques."
   - **Evidence:**
     - **Evidence Text:** "Interestingly, we observed that directly incorporating retrieved knowledge into prompts sometimes degrades answer quality, as seen with KG Retriever and BM25 Retriever performing worse than the vanilla GPT-3.5 model."
     - **Strength:** Strong
     - **Limitations:** The claim is based on a single dataset and may not generalize to other domains.
     - **Location:** Section 4.4.2

4. **Claim 4: MindMap leverages both external and implicit knowledge**
   - **Type:** Methodology
   - **Location:** Section 3.3.2
   - **Exact Quote:** "We find that previous retrieval-augmented LLMs tend to rephrase the retrieved facts without exploiting the knowledge of LLM itself. However, MindMap enables LLM to synergistically infer from both the retrieved evidence graphs and its own knowledge."
   - **Evidence:**
     - **Evidence Text:** "We attribute this ability to three aspects: (1) Language Understanding, as LLM can comprehend and extract the knowledge from Gm and the query in natural language, (2) Knowledge Reasoning, as LLM can perform entity disambiguation and produce the final answer based on the mind map constructed from Gm, and (3) Knowledge Enhancement, as LLM can leverage its implicit knowledge to expand, connect, and improve the information relevant to the query."
     - **Strength:** Strong
     - **Limitations:** None specified
     - **Location:** Section 3.3.2
     - **Exact Quote:** "We find that previous retrieval-augmented LLMs tend to rephrase the retrieved facts without exploiting the knowledge of LLM itself. However, MindMap enables LLM to synergistically infer from both the retrieved evidence graphs and its own knowledge."

5. **Claim 5: MindMap improves factual correctness and disease diagnosis**
   - **Type:** Performance
   - **Location:** Section 4.6.2
   - **Exact Quote:** "The question in Figure 6 contains misleading symptom facts, such as ‘jaundice in my eyes’ leading baseline models to retrieve irrelevant knowledge linked to ‘eye’. This results in failure to identify the correct disease, with recommended drugs and tests unrelated to liver disease. In contrast, our model MindMap accurately identifies cirrhosis and recommends the relevant ‘blood test’ showcasing its robustness."
   - **Evidence:**
     - **Evidence Text:** "In Figure 6, MindMap accurately identifies cirrhosis and recommends the relevant ‘blood test’ showcasing its robustness."
