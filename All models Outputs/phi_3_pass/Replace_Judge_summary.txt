=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: We propose instead to evaluate models using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL).
Location: Abstract
Type: Proposal
Quote: We propose instead to evaluate models using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL).

Evidence:
- We propose instead to evaluate models using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2
  Limitations: None
  Quote: We propose to evaluate LLM generations using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL).

- Using a PoLL composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1 and 4.2
  Limitations: None
  Quote: We show that using an instantiation of PoLL correlates better with human judgements compared to a single large judge (Sections 4.1 and 4.2).

- Using a PoLL exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4
  Limitations: None
  Quote: Intra-model scoring bias is reduced by pooling judgements across a panel of heterogeneous evaluator models (Section 4.4).

- Using a PoLL is over seven times less expensive than using a single large judge.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.5
  Limitations: None
  Quote: At the time of writing, the cost of running our specific instance of PoLL is $1.25/input[11] + $4.25/output, whereas the cost of running GPT-4 Turbo is $10/input + $30/output.

- A PoLL correlates better with human judgements compared to a single large judge.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1 and 4.2
  Limitations: None
  Quote: We show that using an instantiation of PoLL correlates better with human judgements compared to a single large judge (Sections 4.1 and 4.2).

- GPT-4 is a relatively weak judge, exhibiting high variance with minor changes to the prompt.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: None
  Quote: Based on the observation that GPT-4 was the weakest judge model on our KILT evaluations, we investigated how the model reacts to modifications to its prompt.

- Intra-model scoring bias is reduced by pooling judgements across a panel of heterogeneous evaluator models.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4
  Limitations: None
  Quote: Intra-model scoring bias is reduced by pooling judgements across a panel of heterogeneous evaluator models (Section 4.4).

- A PoLL is not only effective but also reduces intra-model bias, latency, and cost.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: None
  Quote: In this paper, we showed how a Panel of LLM Evaluators composed of smaller models is not only an effective method for evaluating LLM performance, but also reduces intra-model bias, latency, and cost.

- There is not a single 'best' judge across all settings, while PoLL performs well consistently.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: None
  Quote: The benefits of PoLL are bolstered by the finding that there is not a single ’best’ judge across all settings, while PoLL performs well consistently.
