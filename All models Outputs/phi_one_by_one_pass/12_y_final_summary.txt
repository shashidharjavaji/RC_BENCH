#### Instructions:In the given paper, identify and extract the key components of the Hallucination Augmented Contrastive Learning (HACL) method, focusing on its novel approach to addressing hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Present your findings in a structured JSON format, detailing the method's core principles, the role of contrastive learning, and the utilization of hallucinative captions as hard negative samples. Ensure your JSON object includes sections on 'Introduction', 'Methodology', 'Key Components', and 'Conclusion', each with relevant sub-points extracted directly from the text. ```json
{
  "HACL_Method": {
    "Introduction": {
      "Context": "Hallucinations in MLLMs are erroneous or fabricated information not matching visual input, a significant limitation.",
