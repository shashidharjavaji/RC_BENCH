Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that the proposed method can be used to update or erase specific factual knowledge in pretrained Transformers without fine-tuning, as demonstrated by two preliminary studies. The first study shows a nontrivial success rate for updating facts by directly modifying the knowledge neurons, while the second study demonstrates the ability to erase specific relations by setting the corresponding knowledge neurons to zero vectors. The success of these operations suggests that precise fact editing is possible without the need for fine-tuning.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on experiments conducted on a well-known dataset (PARAREL) and uses a systematic approach to identify and manipulate knowledge neurons. The results show a clear pattern of increased perplexity when knowledge is erased, which supports the claim.
  Limitations: The studies are preliminary and do not cover all types of knowledge or all possible editing scenarios. The success rate for updating facts is described as nontrivial, suggesting that while the method works, it may not be universally effective or may require further refinement.

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.1 Knowledge Assessing Task
  Limitations: The method focuses on explicit factual knowledge and may not capture implicit knowledge expression.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The proposed method effectively identifies knowledge neurons by using the fill-in-the-blank cloze task, where the activation of these neurons correlates positively with the expression of the corresponding facts.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on the empirical analysis of the activation patterns of neurons in response to the cloze task, which is a direct method for assessing factual knowledge in pretrained models.
  Limitations: The method is limited to assessing knowledge based on the fill-in-the-blank cloze task and may not capture all forms of knowledge expression.

This suggests that the activation of knowledge neurons is a reliable indicator of whether a prompt contains knowledge-expressing content.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a comparison of average activation levels across different types of prompts, which were systematically categorized to represent knowledge-expressing and non-expressing prompts.
  Limitations: The study may be limited by the scope of prompts analyzed and the potential for other factors influencing neuron activation that were not accounted for. Additionally, the method's reliance on a specific dataset (BINGREL) may affect its generalizability to other datasets or contexts.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors suggest that the method for identifying knowledge neurons has potential applicability to multilingual pretrained Transformers, as indicated by the mention of related work on multilingual models and the identification of this as a future direction.
