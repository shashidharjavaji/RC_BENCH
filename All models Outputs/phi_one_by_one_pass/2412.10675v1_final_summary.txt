Location: Abstract

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Reinforcement learning with our novel 'Longest Contiguous Common Subsequence' reward emerged as the most effective, contributing to both plan executability and validity.

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.7
  Limitations: The study mentions that the reward system's bias towards a single reference plan could be a limitation.

Claim 8:
Statement: Permutation augmentation enables the model to effectively parse unseen problem content.
Location: 4.3 The Secret Help of Permutation

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Permutation augmentation does not significantly improve the validity rate, but largely enhances the executability rate.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Does not directly address the model's ability to parse unseen problem content, but rather its effect on executability.

- Evidence Text: The model is able to effectively parse unseen problem content, as indicated by high precision and recall rates in mistake identification probing tests.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: The probing tests measure the model's ability to identify mistakes, not necessarily its ability to parse unseen problem content.
  Exact Quote: Results from Table 3 showed that the model is able to accurately identify errors, achieving particularly high precision (90.5%) and recall (99.2%) when all 4 strategies are combined (row 9).

- Evidence Text: The model tends to ignore the obfuscated domain context and instead produced actions from the original Blocksworld domain.

Claim 9:
Statement: Goal CoT is the only strategy that hinders planning performance among OOD cases, showing no improvement whatsoever.
Location: 4.3 The Secret Help of Permutation

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Goal CoT is the only strategy that hinders planning performance among OOD cases, showing no improvement whatsoever.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: The claim does not consider the potential of Goal CoT in in-distribution scenarios or its impact on executability.
  Exact Quote: Goal CoT is the only strategy that hinders planning performance among OOD cases, showing no improvement whatsoever.

- Evidence Text: The model exhibits a noticeable bias towards estimating numbers within the range of plan lengths that it has previously encountered during the training stage.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: This evidence does not directly address Goal CoT's impact on planning performance but suggests a limitation in LLM's generalization that could affect Goal CoT.
  Exact Quote: The model exhibits a noticeable bias towards estimating numbers within the range of plan lengths that it has previously encountered during the training stage.

- Evidence Text: The Goal CoT’s ability to enhance the model’s understanding of state transition dynamics may likely be limited to the plan length distribution it encountered during training.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.6
  Limitations: This evidence suggests a limitation of Goal CoT but does not directly contradict the claim that it hinders planning performance.
  Exact Quote: The Goal CoT’s ability to enhance the model’s understanding of state transition dynamics may likely be limited to the plan length distribution it encountered during training.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that Goal CoT hinders planning performance among OOD cases, showing no improvement whatsoever. This conclusion is based on the observation that Goal CoT introduces complexity by requiring the model to estimate the goal distance, which may not align with the training distribution, leading to a bias towards estimating numbers within the range of plan lengths seen during training. Additionally, the authors suggest that the State CoT's ability to enhance executability is limited to the plan length distribution encountered during training, implying that Goal CoT may also be limited in this way.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is relatively robust, as it is based on empirical results from the study and supported by theoretical considerations about the limitations of Goal CoT.
  Limitations: The study focuses on the end-to-end plan generation paradigm and may not generalize to other planning paradigms. The authors also acknowledge that the Goal CoT's performance may be influenced by the specific implementation of the strategy.
