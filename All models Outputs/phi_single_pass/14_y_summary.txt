Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Visual prompt dependency measure (PDM) decreases as more tokens are generated, leading to more hallucinations.
Location: Section 3
Exact Quote: we demonstrate that, as more tokens are generated, the conditioning information gets diluted and “forgotten” or ignored by the model, possibly leading to more hallucinations.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: PDM decreases as more tokens are generated, as shown in Fig. 3.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3
  Limitations: The figure shows a correlation but does not establish causation.
  Exact Quote: Fig. 3. The influence of the image conditioning decreases as we generate more tokens.

- Evidence Text: The number of hallucinated objects increases as the PDM gets smaller.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3
  Limitations: Correlation does not imply causation; other factors may contribute to hallucinations.
  Exact Quote: Note that very few objects are hallucinated for tokens near the visual prompt, while their number increases as the PDM gets smaller.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence shows a clear trend of decreasing PDM with increasing token generation, which is associated with increased hallucinations.
Key Limitations: The study does not establish a direct causal relationship between PDM and hallucinations.
