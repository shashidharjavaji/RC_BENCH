Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: The paper proposes new methods to extract and profile climate change statements from the IPCC AR6 reports.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: We propose new methods to extract and profile the climate change statements from the Sixth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors designed and implemented a tool to extract scientific statements from IPCC reports and represented them with associated uncertainty levels and glossary terms.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Methodology
  Limitations: The paper does not discuss the limitations of the tool developed.
  Exact Quote: First, we design and implement a tool to extract scientific statements from IPCC Working Group (WG) reports.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The authors have developed a tool to extract and profile climate change statements, which is a clear methodological contribution.
Key Limitations: None mentioned

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: The paper profiles the distribution of 10,393 statements across different parts of the IPCC AR6 reports.
Location: Results
Exact Quote: We present a comprehensive profile of 10,393 statements across three IPCC WG reports.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors analyzed the distribution of statements across the IPCC AR6 reports and found that WGII has a higher proportion of high and very-high confidence statements.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results
  Limitations: The paper does not discuss the limitations of the analysis.
  Exact Quote: Our analysis shows that WGII has a higher proportion of high and very-high confidence statements.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The authors have analyzed the distribution of statements across the IPCC AR6 reports, which is a clear result.
Key Limitations: None mentioned

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: The paper presents three case studies centered around the glossary term 'wetland'.
Location: Case Studies
Exact Quote: We present three case studies that take the first steps towards linking related statements, identifying supporting references, and comparing statement summarization with large language models.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors linked related statements across summary sections and chapter content, found supporting references, and compared statement summarization with large language models.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Case Studies
  Limitations: The paper does not discuss the limitations of the case studies.
  Exact Quote: We present three case studies that take the first steps towards linking related statements, identifying supporting references, and comparing statement summarization with large language models.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The authors have conducted three case studies, which are a clear result.
Key Limitations: None mentioned

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 4:
Type: contribution
Statement: The paper lays the groundwork for more advanced automated analysis of climate-related statements and broader integrative scientific assessments.
Location: Conclusion
Exact Quote: It lays the groundwork for more advanced automated analysis of climate-related statements and broader integrative scientific assessments.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The paper has developed a tool to extract and profile climate change statements, which can be used for further research and analysis.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Conclusion
  Limitations: The paper does not discuss the limitations of the tool developed.
  Exact Quote: It lays the groundwork for more advanced automated analysis of climate-related statements and broader integrative scientific assessments.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
