To adapt our model for handling ambiguous questions, we fine-tuned the model using OpenAI’s API. We randomly sampled 50 question-answer pairs from AmbigQA. Each ambiguous question was stored as the prompt for the LLM, with ground truth being stored as the expected response from the LLM. The file was formatted as shown below for the 50 questions. Using this, we initiated a fine-tuning job on OpenAI’s fine-tuning API [8] which returned a model checkpoint. We used this fine-tuned model ID instead of gpt-4o-mini within our baseline prompt configuration. To evaluate the performance of this fine-tuned model, we sample 1,000 ambiguous questions from the dataset at random and compare the performance between naive prompting on the 4o-mini model and naive prompting on the fine-tuned 4o-mini model. The GT Answer Overlap for the 4o-mini model is 0.643 while that for the fine-tuned 4o-mini model is 0.626. Therefore, we see that fine-tuning, at least at this small scale, does not provide any improvement in LLM performance on ambiguous questions."
