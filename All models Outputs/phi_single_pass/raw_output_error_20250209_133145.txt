 The research paper titled "Learning to Generate Research Idea with Dynamic Control" presents a novel framework for generating research ideas using a two-stage approach that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and controllable Reinforcement Learning (RL). The paper addresses the limitations of current LLM-based systems in optimizing generated content and dealing with the complex interdependence among novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness. The proposed framework employs a two-stage approach, SFT and RL, with dimensional controllers and a sentence-level decoder to dynamically adjust the generation process.

The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed framework, including a human study and automatic evaluation using a dataset of research papers from ICLR and NeurIPS. The results show that the proposed framework outperforms baseline models in terms of novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness, with dynamic decoding providing the best overall performance.

The paper contributes to the field of automated research ideation by providing a balanced approach to generating high-quality research ideas that consider multiple dimensions. The proposed framework can be further developed and applied to various domains to accelerate scientific discovery.

Overall, the paper is well-written, with a clear structure and a comprehensive evaluation. The proposed framework is promising and has the potential to significantly impact the field of automated research ideation. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential future work.
