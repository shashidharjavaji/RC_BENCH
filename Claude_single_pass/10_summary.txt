Statement: kNN-Prompt significantly outperforms baseline models on zero-shot tasks
Location: Results section (Section 4)
Exact Quote: kNN-Prompt outperforms all baselines in all tasks, improving over the base LM by 13.4% on average

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Comprehensive results across 9 tasks showing consistent improvements
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 2
  Limitations: Limited to GPT-2 family models only
  Exact Quote: kNN-Prompt 55.6 53.5 51.0 80.6 84.2 84.3 78.2 60.0 78.8 69.6

- Evidence Text: Detailed ablation studies showing contribution of each component
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 5
  Limitations: Some combinations of components not tested
  Exact Quote: LM+kNN+Fuzzy+PMI (kNN-Prompt) 69.6 +13.4

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks with clear performance improvements and ablation studies
Key Limitations: Limited to GPT-2 models, may not generalize to other architectures

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: contribution
Statement: kNN-Prompt enables effective domain adaptation without additional training
Location: Section 5
Exact Quote: kNN-Prompt performs comparably with DAPT. Specifically, kNN-Prompt slightly outperforms DAPT on CR and MR

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Comparison with DAPT across multiple domains
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Table 4
  Limitations: Limited number of domains tested
  Exact Quote: kNN-prompt 84.3 60.0 78.2, DAPT (LM + PMI) 84.1 61.1 77.8

- Evidence Text: Analysis of datastore size and domain specificity effects
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: Trade-off between datastore size and computational costs not fully explored
  Exact Quote: For CR, using 6M tokens of domain-specific data outperforms using our 465M token heterogeneous corpus

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Shows comparable performance to DAPT without training, supported by detailed analysis
Key Limitations: Limited domain testing, computational costs not fully addressed

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: methodology
Statement: Fuzzy verbalizers are essential for leveraging the kNN distribution effectively
Location: Section 6
Exact Quote: adding kNN to LM gives trivial improvement (+0.4%), but much greater once we add fuzzy verbalizers on top of them (+10.3%)

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Coverage improvement statistics
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6
  Limitations: May depend on specific verbalizer choices
  Exact Quote: across all tasks, an output label receives nonzero probability under the kNN distribution in kNN-LM only 45.8% of the time. With fuzzy verbalizers, this increases to 78%

- Evidence Text: Ablation study results
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 5
  Limitations: Interaction effects between components not fully explored
  Exact Quote: LM+Fuzzy+PMI 67.1 +10.9, LM+kNN+Fuzzy 66.5 +10.3

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Clear evidence from multiple analyses showing importance of fuzzy verbalizers
Key Limitations: Specific verbalizer choices may affect results
