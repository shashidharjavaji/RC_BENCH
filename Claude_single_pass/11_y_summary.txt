Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: MGN achieves superior results against previous network baselines on the LLP dataset
Location: Section 4.2
Exact Quote: the proposed MGN achieves the overall best results against previous network baselines in terms most of metrics

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Achieved gains of 1.6 Type@AV and 1.8 Event@AV for segment-level predictions
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Limited to specific metrics, some audio results not significantly better
  Exact Quote: For the overall evaluation of segment-level predictions, we achieve significant performance gains of 1.6 Type@AV and 1.8 Event@AV

- Evidence Text: Outperforms baselines by 3.5 Visual, 1.4 Audio-Visual, and 1.6 Type@AV for event-level predictions
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Audio improvements less significant than visual
  Exact Quote: Meanwhile, our MGN outperforms baselines by 3.5 Visual, 1.4 Audio-Visual, and 1.6 Tyep@AV for event-level predictions

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Multiple quantitative metrics consistently show improvements over baselines
Key Limitations: Audio modality improvements less substantial than visual

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: contribution
Statement: MGN is more parameter efficient than baseline models
Location: Section 1
Exact Quote: we substantially reduce the parameters of previous work by using only 47.2% parameters of baselines (17 MB vs. 36 MB)

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Model uses only 47.2% of baseline parameters
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Direct parameter count comparison only, no discussion of computational efficiency
  Exact Quote: When the depth of CUG and MCG is 3 and 6, the proposed MGN with only 47.2% parameters of the vanilla baseline performs the best on Type@AV and Event@AV

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Clear parameter reduction while maintaining performance
Key Limitations: No analysis of training time or inference speed

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: MGN reduces false positive predictions compared to baseline models
Location: Section 4.3
Exact Quote: our MGN with explicit grouping mechanisms significantly eliminates false predictions caused by the modality and temporal uncertainties existing in the baseline

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Decreased false positives by 381 for audio and 494 for visual events
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Analysis only compared to HAN baseline
  Exact Quote: our MGN with the class-aware unimodal grouping modules decreases the false positives of audio and visual events by large margins, 381 and 494

- Evidence Text: Reduction of 678 false positives for audio-visual events
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Single dataset evaluation
  Exact Quote: the number of false positives of audio-visual events drops down by 678

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Significant quantitative reduction in false positives across all modalities
Key Limitations: Comparison limited to single baseline model
