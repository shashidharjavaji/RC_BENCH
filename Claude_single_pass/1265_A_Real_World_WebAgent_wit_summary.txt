Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: WebAgent significantly improves the success rate on real websites by over 50% compared to baselines
Location: Section 4.1 Results
Exact Quote: WebAgent achieves best 65% success and 87.6% score on real-estate, 70% success and 85.8% score on social-media, and 80% success and 93.8% score on map, significantly outperforming single Flan-U-PaLM, or with partial language model modules (most of those achieve about 10 - 30% success)

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Detailed performance comparison on real estate, social media and map websites showing WebAgent vs baselines
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: Limited to only 3 types of websites; Number of test cases (20) is relatively small
  Exact Quote: Success rate of real-world web automation on real estate, social media and map websites. WebAgent, with language model modules for planning and summarization, achieves the best success (65%, 70%, 80%, respectively)

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The performance improvements are clearly demonstrated across multiple domains with concrete metrics, though sample size is limited
Key Limitations: Small test set size (20 instructions), limited website domains tested

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: HTML-T5 outperforms prior language model agents on MiniWoB++ benchmark by 18.7%
Location: Section 4.2
Exact Quote: HTML-T5-XL significantly outperforms WebN-T5, the prior best model, by 18.7%

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Comparative performance results on MiniWoB++ benchmark
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 3
  Limitations: Limited to simulated web environment rather than real websites
  Exact Quote: HTML-T5-XL outperforms WebN-T5-XL (Gur et al., 2022), the prior best method, by 18.7%

- Evidence Text: Detailed ablation studies showing benefits of architecture choices
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 2
  Limitations: Some architectural choices tested only on base model size
  Exact Quote: Local and global attention matches to the hierarchical tree structure of HTML, and then improves the success rate by over 18%, compared to the instruction-finetuned dense attentions

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Performance improvement is clearly demonstrated with comprehensive ablation studies supporting architectural choices
Key Limitations: Results limited to simulated benchmark rather than real-world websites

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: methodology
Statement: Local and global attention mechanisms in HTML-T5 better capture hierarchical structures of HTML documents compared to dense attention
Location: Section 4.2 Architecture and Objective
Exact Quote: The combination of local and global attentions achieves the superior success rate by over 18% compared to the instruction-finetuned dense attentions

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Comparative results of different attention mechanisms
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 2 Left
  Limitations: Tests only conducted on base model size
  Exact Quote: Local attention only still surpasses the dense attention by about 9%, which suggests local relation between elements and attributes in HTML are essential for web tasks

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Clear experimental evidence shows benefits of local-global attention, with logical explanation of why it works better for HTML structure
Key Limitations: Limited testing on larger model sizes, could be affected by model scale
