Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: LLMs impersonating children of different ages can recover human-like developmental stages of exploration strategies in a multi-armed bandit task
Location: Section 4.1
Exact Quote: We find that LLMs impersonating older participants generate higher average rewards until age 20 (β = 0.17, p < .001), thereby replicating a general pattern found in the developmental literature

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Average reward increases with age and trial number
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: Limited to ages 2-20, may not generalize beyond
  Exact Quote: LLMs generally improved over trials, i.e. they increase their rewards as they progressed over trials of a game (β = 0.63, p < .001 for ages 2–20 and β = 0.60, p < .001 for ages 20–60)

- Evidence Text: Exploration patterns match developmental psychology findings
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: Correlation only, not causal evidence
  Exact Quote: LLMs pretending to be older explored their environment less (β = −0.03, p < .001) and exploited more (β = 0.04, p < .001) in the ages between 2–20

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Multiple quantitative measures show age-dependent patterns matching human literature
Key Limitations: Only tested on one LLM (Vicuna), limited age range

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: LLMs impersonating domain experts perform better than non-domain experts in reasoning tasks
Location: Section 4.2
Exact Quote: when the LLM is asked to impersonate the task expert, the performance is the highest

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Task expert performance across MMLU domains
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Performance varies significantly by domain
  Exact Quote: Similarly, the domain expert personas perform better than the non-domain expert personas. This trend holds for all four MMLU domains

- Evidence Text: Performance breakdown by expertise type
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Some tasks show minimal expert advantage
  Exact Quote: For the High School Macroeconomics task, the task expert persona performs close to random and to the non-domain expert persona

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Consistent pattern across multiple domains with some exceptions
Key Limitations: Performance varies by task type, some tasks show no expert advantage

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: Impersonation reveals gender and racial biases in LLMs' visual descriptions
Location: Section 4.3
Exact Quote: While the black performs better in car classification, the white performs better in bird classification... while the woman performs clearly better than man for bird classification, the trend is not as strong for car classification

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Statistical significance of biases
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Limited to two datasets (birds and cars)
  Exact Quote: We run Chi2 tests for expertise, race and gender... We find that for all experiments considered, {CUB, Stanford Cars} x {man/woman, black/white, ornithologist/car mechanic}, p<0.001

- Evidence Text: Consistent bias patterns across LLMs
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Only tested on two LLMs
  Exact Quote: ChatGPT tends to describe both birds and cars better when posing as a white person. Vicuna-13B, on the other hand, provides better descriptions of cars as a black person

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Strong statistical evidence and consistency across models
Key Limitations: Limited to two datasets and two LLMs
