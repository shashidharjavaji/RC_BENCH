Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Knowledge neurons are positively correlated with knowledge expression and can be identified using the proposed attribution method
Location: Section 4.5
Exact Quote: suppressing knowledge neurons identified by our knowledge attribution method leads to a consistent decrease (29.03% on average) in the correct probability

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Suppressing neurons decreases correct probability by 29.03%
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.5/Figure 4
  Limitations: Limited to BERT model only; tested on specific relations
  Exact Quote: suppressing knowledge neurons leads to a consistent decrease (29.03% on average) in the correct probability

- Evidence Text: Amplifying neurons increases correct probability by 31.17%
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.5/Figure 5
  Limitations: Same limitations as above
  Exact Quote: we see a consistent increase (31.17% on average) in the correct probability

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Multiple complementary experiments with clear quantitative results support the claim
Key Limitations: Limited to one model architecture and specific knowledge types

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Knowledge neurons are activated more by knowledge-expressing prompts compared to random or control prompts
Location: Section 4.6
Exact Quote: the identified knowledge neurons are more significantly activated by knowledge-expressing prompts (T1 = 0.485), compared with the control groups (T2 = 0.019 and T3 = −0.018)

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Activation values across different prompt types
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.6/Table 4
  Limitations: Based on web-crawled data which may have noise
  Exact Quote: T1 = 0.485, compared with the control groups (T2 = 0.019 and T3 = −0.018)

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Clear quantitative difference in activation patterns across prompt types
Key Limitations: Quality of web-crawled data may affect results

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: contribution
Statement: Knowledge neurons can be used to edit factual knowledge without fine-tuning
Location: Section 5.1-5.2
Exact Quote: the surgery of knowledge neurons achieves a nontrivial success rate for updating facts

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Fact updating success metrics
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.1/Table 6
  Limitations: Limited success rate, only tested on specific relations
  Exact Quote: change rate 48.5%, success rate 34.4%

- Evidence Text: Knowledge erasing results
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.2/Table 5
  Limitations: Tested on only 4 relations
  Exact Quote: the perplexity of the removed knowledge increases as expected

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: low
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Results show proof-of-concept but success rates are moderate
Key Limitations: Limited scale of testing, moderate success rates
