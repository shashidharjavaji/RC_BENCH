Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Larger language models are well-calibrated on diverse multiple choice questions when provided in the right format
Location: Section 2
Exact Quote: when multiple choice problems are formatted in this way... our largest models tend to produce a well-calibrated probability distribution among the available options

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Calibration results shown for BIG Bench tasks with increasing model sizes
  Strength: strong
  Location: Figure 4
  Limitations: Limited to specific formatting approach; may not generalize to other formats
  Exact Quote: We show calibration curves for various model sizes on all of the multiple choice tasks in BIG Bench

- Evidence Text: Calibration demonstrated across multiple datasets including MMLU, TruthfulQA, QuALITY and LogiQA
  Strength: strong
  Location: Figure 6
  Limitations: Performance still depends on specific formatting requirements
  Exact Quote: even on tasks that are difficult for LMs, like LogiQA, and on a somewhat adversarial evaluation like TruthfulQA, large models can achieve good calibration

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Multiple datasets and model sizes show consistent improvement in calibration with scale
Key Limitations: Results depend on specific formatting requirements; may not generalize to all question types

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Models can effectively self-evaluate whether their own samples are correct or incorrect
Location: Section 4
Exact Quote: if given a few examples from a given distribution, models can generate samples and then self-evaluate them to productively differentiate correct and incorrect samples, with reasonably calibrated confidence

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Higher accuracy among responses where P(True) > 0.5 compared to base accuracy
  Strength: strong
  Location: Figure 11
  Limitations: Requires few-shot learning; zero-shot performance is poorer
  Exact Quote: We see that these conditional accuracies are substantially higher than the overall accuracy, with the separation between base and conditional accuracies growing with model size

- Evidence Text: Improved performance when showing multiple samples for comparison
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Benefits vary by task type; less effective for long-form answers
  Exact Quote: models benefit less from this approach on tasks requiring long-form answers (Codex and GMS8k)

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Multiple evaluation approaches show improved accuracy with self-evaluation, though effectiveness varies by context
Key Limitations: Requires few-shot examples; performance varies significantly by task type

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: P(IK) generalizes appropriately to account for source materials and hints
Location: Sections 5.3-5.4
Exact Quote: without any further training, P(IK) generalizes to address whether the language model can find answers to questions in source materials within its context

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: P(IK) increases when relevant Wikipedia articles are provided
  Strength: strong
  Location: Figure 18
  Limitations: Effect size varies with article length
  Exact Quote: Including the article increases P(IK). Furthermore, shorter articles increase P(IK) more

- Evidence Text: P(IK) responds appropriately to good vs bad hints on GSM8k problems
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Figure 19
  Limitations: Models partially fooled by bad hints; tested only on GSM8k
  Exact Quote: We see lower P(IK) scores for bad hints (though the models are partially fooled), and actual decreases in the P(IK) score when the hints are irrelevant

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Clear evidence of appropriate P(IK) adjustment with relevant information, though with some limitations
Key Limitations: Partial vulnerability to bad hints; tested on limited task types
