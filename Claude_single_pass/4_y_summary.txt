Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: FuseMix outperforms CLIP on Flickr30K with significantly less compute and data
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: we outperform CLIP on the Flickr30K text-to-image retrieval task with ~600× fewer GPU days and ~80× fewer image-text pairs

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Computational comparison with CLIP
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction footnotes
  Limitations: Hardware differences not fully specified
  Exact Quote: CLIP trained for ~12 days on 256 V100 GPUs ≈ 3072 GPU days

- Evidence Text: Performance results on Flickr30K
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6.2/Table 1
  Limitations: Limited to one dataset
  Exact Quote: FuseMix(D,B) 5M 71.2 91.4 94.7 84.8 97.2 99.1 compared to CLIP 400M 68.7 90.6 95.2 88.0 98.7 99.4

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Clear numerical evidence shows better performance with less compute and data
Key Limitations: Limited to specific hardware setup and one benchmark

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Dataset diversity significantly improves performance in limited data regimes
Location: Section 6.3
Exact Quote: we find that with access to limited data, sourcing image-text pairs that are maximally diverse provides substantial improvements of up to nearly 40% compared to selecting image-text pairs without consideration for diversity

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: DPP diversity experiment results
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6.3/Figure 3c
  Limitations: Specific diversity metric effects not fully explored
  Exact Quote: in Figure 3c we find that with access to limited data, sourcing image-text pairs that are maximally diverse provides substantial improvements

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Results show clear performance gains from diversity but methodology could be more detailed
Key Limitations: Limited exploration of different diversity metrics and selection methods

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: capability
Statement: FuseMix can effectively repurpose text-to-image models for audio-to-image generation
Location: Section 6.4
Exact Quote: conditioning GLIDE on audio prompts using FuseMix can produce samples of similar quality and fidelity as conditioning on text prompts

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Qualitative comparison of generated images
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6.4/Figure 4
  Limitations: Only qualitative evaluation, no quantitative metrics
  Exact Quote: We find it noteworthy that conditioning GLIDE on audio prompts using FuseMix can produce samples of similar quality and fidelity as conditioning on text prompts, even though GLIDE itself was never trained with audio data

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Visual examples support claim but lack of quantitative evaluation limits confidence
Key Limitations: No objective metrics for comparison, limited to qualitative assessment
