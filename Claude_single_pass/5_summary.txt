Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: CounterFact dataset mixes different prediction scenarios and contains problematic samples, making it unsuitable for precise LM interpretations
Location: Section 3
Exact Quote: This is motivated by an inspection of the 1,209 samples from CounterFact which reveals 510 samples likely to rely on heuristics and 365 samples to have a low popularity scores and thus be unlikely to have been memorized

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: 510 samples found to potentially correspond to heuristics
  Strength: strong
  Location: Appendix F.1
  Limitations: Heuristics detection may not be perfect
  Exact Quote: We find a total of 510 samples that may correspond to heuristics recall, of which 335 samples correspond to prompt bias, 155 to name bias and 20 to both name and prompt bias

- Evidence Text: 365 samples with low popularity unlikely to be memorized
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Appendix F.1
  Limitations: Popularity is a proxy for memorization
  Exact Quote: We find approximately 365 known CounterFact samples with popularity scores below 1000. These are unlikely to have been memorized by the model

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Multiple analyses with quantitative evidence show mixing of scenarios and problematic samples
Key Limitations: Heuristics detection methods may miss some cases

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Different prediction scenarios yield fundamentally different causal tracing results when analyzed in isolation
Location: Section 4.2
Exact Quote: We find that different prediction scenarios yield distinct CT results if studied in isolation

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Exact fact recall shows clear peak in last subject token, mid layer MLPs
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Limited to specific models tested
  Exact Quote: Exact fact recall results Figure 3d show a clear peak in AIE in (last subject token, mid layer) MLP states and all other states (last token, other subject tokens) reduce in relative effect

- Evidence Text: Other scenarios show different patterns
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Some overlap between patterns
  Exact Quote: This is fundamentally different from the other scenarios, where this state is either found to have a low AIE or to have comparatively the same importance as other states

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Clear visualization and quantitative evidence shows distinct patterns
Key Limitations: Results specific to tested models and architectures

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: Aggregated causal tracing results are dominated by exact fact recall samples
Location: Section 4.2
Exact Quote: This indicates that model interpretations over samples mixing prediction scenarios are misleading as they may be dominated by the characteristics of the exact fact recall scenario

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Combined plot reproduces exact fact recall pattern
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Tested on limited number of models
  Exact Quote: The combined plot of exact fact recall, heuristics recall, and guesswork samples in Figure 3e generally reproduces the same CT results as observed in previous work

- Evidence Text: Normalized results show weaker dominance
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Appendix G
  Limitations: Normalization approach has limitations
  Exact Quote: For the normalized results we find that equal weights for all evaluated samples yield a slightly different pattern compared to the non-normalized results, with a weaker peak for the last subject token

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Multiple analyses support the claim though normalization shows some nuance
Key Limitations: Limited model testing and normalization approach limitations
