Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: REALM outperforms all previous approaches on Open-QA tasks by a significant margin (4-16% absolute accuracy)
Location: Section 4.4 Main Results
Exact Quote: REALM outperform all previous approaches by a significant margin.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Detailed performance comparison on NQ, WQ, and CT datasets showing REALM achieving best scores
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: Limited to 3 specific benchmarks
  Exact Quote: Ours (X = CC-News, Z = Wikipedia) achieves 40.4% on NQ, 40.7% on WQ, and 42.9% on CT

- Evidence Text: Comparison with T5-11B showing better performance with smaller model
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4
  Limitations: T5 uses additional training data not available to REALM
  Exact Quote: REALM outperforms the largest T5-11B model while being 30 times smaller

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Comprehensive empirical results across multiple datasets with clear improvements over baselines
Key Limitations: Limited to specific QA tasks, may not generalize to other domains

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: Salient span masking is crucial for REALM's performance
Location: Section 4.5 Analysis
Exact Quote: While such salient span masking has not been shown to be impactful in previous work with standard BERT training, it is crucial for REALM.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Ablation study comparing different masking schemes
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Table 2
  Limitations: Only tested on NQ development set
  Exact Quote: REALM with random uniform masks: 32.3, REALM with random span masks: 35.3

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Clear performance drop with alternative masking schemes, though limited to one dataset
Key Limitations: Ablation only on one dataset, mechanism not fully explained

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: Both retriever and encoder components benefit from REALM pre-training
Location: Section 4.5 Analysis
Exact Quote: We find that both the encoder and retriever benefit from REALM training separately, but the best result requires both components acting in unison.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Ablation results showing performance with reset components
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 2
  Limitations: Only tested on NQ development set
  Exact Quote: REALM retriever+Baseline encoder: 37.4, Baseline retriever+REALM encoder: 35.3, Baseline (ORQA): 31.3

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Clear empirical evidence showing benefits to both components individually and together
Key Limitations: Results from single dataset ablation
