Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: The HTML model achieves significantly better prediction accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art MDRM model
Location: Results and Discussion section
Exact Quote: The HTML model achieves the highest prediction performance (lowest MSE values) for each of the target time-periods

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Specific error improvements relative to MDRM: 3-days (+38.4%), 7-days (+16.9%), 15-days (+49.0%), and 30-days(+38.7%)
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results section
  Limitations: Limited to one dataset/year (2017)
  Exact Quote: These error improvements relative to MDRM are substantial significant, varying with the time-period as follows: 3-days (+38.4%), 7-days (+16.9%), 15-days (+49.0%), and 30-days(+38.7%)

- Evidence Text: Comprehensive comparison across multiple baselines shown in Table 2
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results section - Table 2
  Limitations: Some baseline comparisons may be using different implementations
  Exact Quote: Table 2 shows the average n-day volatility prediction errors for our approach (HTML) and the various baselines

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Multiple quantitative comparisons across different timeframes consistently show substantial improvements
Key Limitations: Limited to one year of data, single dataset evaluation

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Audio features provide greater benefit for short-term volatility prediction compared to long-term
Location: Section 6.2
Exact Quote: HTML delivers its most accurate short-term predictions using text+audio, but its most accurate long-term predictions come from the text-only version

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Statistical significance of audio benefits only for n=3 prediction
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6.2
  Limitations: Exact p-values not provided for all timeframes
  Exact Quote: For HTML, the benefits of using multimodel learning are statistically significant for n=3 only, however (p â‰¤ 0.01)

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Statistical evidence supports short-term benefit but more detailed statistical analysis for other timeframes would strengthen the claim
Key Limitations: Limited statistical reporting for longer timeframes

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: methodology
Statement: The multi-task learning approach improves prediction performance compared to single-task approach
Location: Section 6.4
Exact Quote: most of the multi-task variations in Table 3 present that we superior prediction performance when compared to the corresponding single-task variation

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Ablation study results in Table 3 comparing HTSL vs HTML performance
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6.4 and Table 3
  Limitations: Not all differences may be statistically significant
  Exact Quote: On a like-for-like basis, most of the multi-task variations in Table 3 present that we superior prediction performance when compared to the corresponding single-task variation

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Empirical evidence from ablation study supports the claim, though statistical significance testing would strengthen it
Key Limitations: Lack of statistical significance testing for performance differences
