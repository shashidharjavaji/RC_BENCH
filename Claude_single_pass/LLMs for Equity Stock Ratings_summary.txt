Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: LLM benchmark method outperforms traditional analyst stock ratings when assessed by forward returns
Location: Results section 5.1
Exact Quote: In Table 1, the Vanilla method has a lower MAE of 1.447 compared to the Analyst predictions, which has a Return MAE of 1.570.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Comparative MAE scores from Table 1
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: MAE differences are relatively small; higher standard deviation for Vanilla method
  Exact Quote: Vanilla: Return MAE ± Std: 1.447 ± 0.745, Analyst: Return MAE ± Std: 1.570 ± 0.637

- Evidence Text: Standard deviation comparison showing less consistency in LLM predictions
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Results section 5.1
  Limitations: Only one metric of performance evaluation
  Exact Quote: However, the standard deviation of the Vanilla method is 0.745, higher than the Analyst's 0.637, suggesting that while the predictions are more consistent, they are less accurate overall.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The MAE metrics provide direct numerical comparison, though the difference is modest and comes with higher variance
Key Limitations: Higher standard deviation in LLM predictions suggests less reliability; single performance metric

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Fundamentals + Sentiment experiment provides the best overall performance in stock rating predictions
Location: Results section 5.3
Exact Quote: Table 1 shows that the Fundamentals + Sentiment experiment has the best performance in terms of Return MAE, with a value of 1.417, indicating the most accurate predictions.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: MAE comparison across all methods
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: Small differences between methods
  Exact Quote: Fundamentals + Sentiment: Return MAE ± Std: 1.417 ± 0.747

- Evidence Text: Performance across time horizons
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results section 5.3
  Limitations: Variable performance across different time periods
  Exact Quote: Both the Fundamentals and Fundamentals + Sentiment experiments consistently perform best across most months, particularly excelling in the 3, 6, and 12-month periods.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Consistent superior performance across multiple metrics and time horizons
Key Limitations: Performance advantages are small; effectiveness varies by time horizon

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: News summaries are more effective for short-term predictions than long-term forecasts
Location: Results section 5.2
Exact Quote: Figure 3 shows that the News (Summary) experiment performs best in the 1-month period, outperforming all other experiments in both Return and Sector MAE.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Performance comparison across time horizons
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results section 5.2
  Limitations: Limited explanation of why this occurs
  Exact Quote: This suggests news summaries provide better short-term predictions, likely because we include summaries from the previous month, therefore offering a clearer picture of recent company performance.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Clear performance pattern shown in results, though mechanistic explanation is limited
Key Limitations: Lack of detailed analysis of why news effectiveness decreases over longer horizons
