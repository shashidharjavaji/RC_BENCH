While MarS generally performs well to simulate the normal market, its performance drops during the manipulation, showing a heavier tail and a peak around \u03b4 = 1000. These anomalies can be viewed as signals likely corresponding to market manipulation, where manipulators significantly impact liquidity, widening the spread. These anomalies, less frequent in normal markets, lead to a performance drop in MarS, suggesting a new detection approach by monitoring such similarity drops."
