Claim 2:
Type: contribution
Statement: With a domain- or task-relevant datastore, kNN-Prompt enables efficient domain adaptation with no additional training.
Location: Conclusions section
Exact Quote: With a domain- or task-relevant datastore, kNN-Prompt enables efficient domain adaptation with no additional training.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: kNN-Prompt performs comparably with DAPT on domain adaptation, slightly outperforming DAPT on CR and MR without further training.
