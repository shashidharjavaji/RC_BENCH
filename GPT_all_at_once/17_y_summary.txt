Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Combining tabular data from financial semi-structured documents with text transcripts and audio recordings improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12% along with reduction in gender bias learned by audio-based neural networks by over 30%.
Location: Conclusion and Future Work
Exact Quote: combining tabular data from financial semi-structured documents with text transcripts and audio recordings improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12% along with reduction in gender bias learned by audio-based neural networks by over 30%

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Ablation analysis of M3A model augmented with DocEmbedding for each modality shows best performance when combining audio, text and tabular data.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 5
  Limitations: Limited to situations where modalities are combined; does not account for data unavailability or quality issues.
  Exact Quote: Combining audio, text and tabular data gives best performance

- Evidence Text: Utilizing text transcripts with table data from financial documents instead of its audio counterpart does not deteriorate the model performance, which suggests an effective alternative to audio input for reducing gender bias without significant performance degradation.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Table 5 & Bias Reduction section
  Limitations: Based on an ablation study, it might not generalize across all possible datasets or scenarios.
  Exact Quote: utilizing text transcripts with table data from financial documents instead of its audio counterpart does not deteriorate the model performance

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence provided multiple aspects of experimental data to support the claim, though it's based on specific datasets and methods.
Key Limitations: Experiment-centric and dataset-specific; gender bias reduction specific to the case study on financial calls.
