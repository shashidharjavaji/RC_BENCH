Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: JMRI framework combines early joint representation and deep cross-modal interaction for visual grounding
Location: Section I & V
Exact Quote: this article presents a joint multimodal representation and interaction framework for visual grounding, called JMRI, which is based on the image–text foundation model and transformer.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: JMRI uses CLIP for initial feature extraction and alignment, and transformer for deep fusion to process and enhance intermodal correlations for localization.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section II & III
  Limitations: Depends on the effectiveness of pre-trained CLIP and transformer models.
  Exact Quote: our framework first performs feature alignment in a multimodal semantic space learned by CLIP. CLIP gains the ability of intermodal alignment by jointly contrastively training the dual-encoder and projection layer for image–text matching.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The methodology is supported by the integration of pre-trained models and innovative use of transformers for localization, producing high-quality visual representations linked with language expressions.
Key Limitations: Performance is contingent on the training and generalization capabilities of the underlying CLIP and transformer models.

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: JMRI achieves high performance with lower training cost
Location: Section V
Exact Quote: By freezing the pretrained CLIP and updating the other modules, we achieve the best performance with the least training budget and deployment cost.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of JMRI against state-of-the-art methods.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section IV-D
  Limitations: Comparative analysis is limited to specific datasets and metrics; real-world applicability may vary.
  Exact Quote: To validate the merits of the proposed JMRI, we conduct evaluations on five public benchmark datasets and compare its performance against the state-of-the-art methods.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence supports the claim through comparative analysis and by highlighting the method's efficiency in leveraging pre-trained models for reduced training cost. The claim is credible given the extensive experimentation.
Key Limitations: The evaluation context is somewhat limited; broader testing and deployment scenarios would strengthen the claim.

Claim 3:
Type: methodology
Statement: JMRI effectively aligns and processes visual and linguistic features in a unified semantic space
Location: Section II-B
Exact Quote: our framework first performs feature alignment in a multimodal semantic space learned by CLIP.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: JMRI exploits the dual-encoder and projection layer of the pretrained CLIP model for initial feature extraction and alignment in a shared semantic space before deep fusion.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section II-B
  Limitations: Relies heavily on the quality and comprehensiveness of the pretrained CLIP model.
  Exact Quote: CLIP gains the ability of intermodal alignment by jointly contrastively training the dual-encoder and projection layer for image–text matching.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The approach efficiently leverages the CLIP model's pre-training for feature alignment, ensuring a strong semantic understanding imperative for visual grounding tasks.
Key Limitations: Effectiveness is directly tied to CLIP's initial training; might not fully encompass certain visual-linguistic nuances not covered in pre-training.
