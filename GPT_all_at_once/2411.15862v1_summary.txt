Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: Implicit CoT does not perform step-by-step reasoning like explicit CoT in handling multi-step arithmetic problems.
Location: Introduction/Approach sections
Exact Quote: our study designs a elaborate set of experiments aimed at uncovering the implicit reasoning processes... handling multi-step arithmetic problems without resorting to outputting explicit intermediate steps.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experiment leveraging Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct on simple arithmetic problems to test implicit reasoning without outputting intermediate steps.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Approach section
  Limitations: Limited to arithmetic problems; doesn't cover broader reasoning tasks.
  Exact Quote: In our experiment, we leverage a powerful open-source model, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, to tackle simple arithmetic problems that are easily solvable via typical CoT reasoning...

- Evidence Text: Model often gives correct answers in implicit reasoning but does not calculate intermediate results.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results of Probing Intermediate Steps section
  Limitations: Inference based on observing hidden states and probing; not direct observation of reasoning process.
  Exact Quote: The experiment results are surprising and counter-intuitive: we find the model hardly calculates the intermediate results in implicit reasoning, despite it can often give the correct answer...

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Evidence based on detailed experiments with a sophisticated model suggests implicit CoT doesn't involve step-by-step reasoning. Limitation arises from focusing on arithmetic problems and indirect measurement of reasoning process.
Key Limitations: Study is specific to arithmetic problems and uses probing of hidden states as indirect evidence.

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: Implicit reasoning process is less robust and reliable compared to explicit CoT.
Location: Conclusion section
Exact Quote: implicit reasoning cannot be on par with explicit reasoning methods because it actually does not follow a step-by-step process but just intuitively thinks of the answer, which makes it less reliable.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Accuracy suffers significantly in implicit reasoning when problem presentation is slightly modified without increasing actual difficulty.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Result of Slightly Perturbing the Prompt section
  Limitations: Testing limited to modified arithmetic problems; may not fully generalize to all types of reasoning tasks.
  Exact Quote: From the results in Table 1, we can clearly see that, compared to the original problems, the modified problems significantly degrade the performance when using implicit reasoning.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Strong evidence from performance metrics explicitly demonstrates reduced robustness and reliability of implicit reasoning under modifications. Limitations relating to the focus on arithmetic problems apply.
Key Limitations: Findings primarily apply to arithmetic problem-solving; broader reasoning tasks were not tested.
