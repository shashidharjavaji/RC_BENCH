Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Apathetic voting by users that are un-incentivized can significantly alter model rankings on Chatbot Arena.
Location: Section 3.1 Apathetic Voting
Exact Quote: we find that only 10% of apathetic votes in the dataset can change the leaderboard rankings of 2/3 models by 5 places

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: 10% of apathetic votes can change the leaderboard rankings of models by up to 5 places.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.1 Apathetic Voting
  Limitations: Based on a specific dataset of 55k preferences and may not generalize across different contexts or datasets.
  Exact Quote: we find that only 10% of apathetic votes in the dataset can change the leaderboard rankings of 2/3 models by 5 places

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is data-driven and based on a controlled experiment with a significant sample size.
Key Limitations: Does not account for potential differences in voting patterns across different user groups or platforms.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Adversarial voting can materially impact leaderboard rankings on Chatbot Arena.
Location: Section 3.2 Adversarial Voting
Exact Quote: adversarial attacks can substantially change leaderboard rankings if adversaries get to contribute 10% votes for their model

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: 10% adversarial votes can change the rank of all systems by more than 4 places.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.2 Adversarial Voting
  Limitations: Assumes the ability of adversaries to consistently contribute a significant fraction of votes, which might not be feasible in practice.
  Exact Quote: adversarial attacks can substantially change leaderboard rankings if adversaries get to contribute 10% votes for their model

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Supported by experimental data showcasing the potential for significant ranking shifts due to adversarial votes.
Key Limitations: Potential real-world constraints on adversarial behavior, such as platform security measures, are not considered.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: contribution
Statement: Arbitrary voting on inherently subjective queries can introduce substantial noise into model rankings.
Location: Section 3.3 Arbitrary Voting
Exact Quote: holistically rating a response to an open-ended and inherently subjective query is ill-defined and liable to always be arbitrary

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Inter-annotator agreement analysis shows arbitrariness in subjective evaluation of model outputs.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3.3 Arbitrary Voting
  Limitations: Study conducted with only four annotators, limiting the generalizability of findings.
  Exact Quote: Overall, we find very low agreement between annotators in our small-scale study.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: low
Confidence Level: low
Justification: Empirical evidence from a small-scale study indicates significant subjective variability, supporting the claim.
Key Limitations: Limited sample size and lack of diversity in annotator backgrounds may not reflect broader population.
