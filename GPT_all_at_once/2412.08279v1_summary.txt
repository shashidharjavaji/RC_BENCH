Claim 1:
Type: contribution
Statement: Y-NQ is a newly released dataset that enables comparison of LLM results in reading comprehension tasks between English and Yorùbá, highlighting generalization capabilities.
Location: Conclusions section
Exact Quote: Y-NQ is a newly released dataset that enables to compare generative open-book reading comprehension between English and Yorùbá.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Y-NQ contains 358 questions and answers on 338 English documents and 208 Yorùbá documents, aiming to assess model performance in both a high-resource (English) and a low-resource (Yorùbá) language.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction section
  Limitations: Inherent dataset biases, such as the significantly shorter length of Yorùbá documents compared to English documents.
  Exact Quote: The dataset contains 358 questions and answers on 338 English documents and 208 Yorùbá documents.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The dataset setup provides a clear basis for comparison between English and Yorùbá, although disparities in document length and resource availability potentially bias outcomes.
Key Limitations: Disparities in document length; limited domain and size of Yorùbá dataset.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Experiments show that current English LLMs' reading comprehension capabilities do not extend to Yorùbá.
Location: Conclusions section
Exact Quote: Our experiments show that the reading comprehension capabilities of current English LLMs do not extend to Yorùbá.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Automatic metrics reveal Yorùbá performs consistently worse than English, indicating a drop in model performance when dealing with Yorùbá documents.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Experiments section
  Limitations: Reliance on automatic evaluation metrics like Rouge, which may not fully capture comprehension accuracy.
  Exact Quote: Table 4 reports the results showing that Yorùbá consistently performs worse than English.

- Evidence Text: The results exhibit a consistent disparity in performance between the two languages, with a significant performance drop for Yorùbá in documents of comparable length to English.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction section
  Limitations: Does not account for potential qualitative nuances in comprehension beyond quantifiable metrics.
  Exact Quote: Experiments show a consistent disparity in performance between the two languages.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The consistency of performance disparity across different evaluation metrics robustly supports the claim, despite potential evaluation metric limitations.
Key Limitations: Over-reliance on Rouge metrics; limited sample size for documents of comparable length.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: methodology
Statement: The Y-NQ dataset not being fully comparable between English and Yorùbá due to variations in document and answer length introduces biases in performance evaluation.
Location: Limitations and Ethical considerations section
Exact Quote: Furthermore, the data set is not fully comparable between English and Yorùbá, since documents and answers vary in length.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: English documents are longer than Yorùbá documents, making the reading comprehension task ostensibly easier for Yorùbá due to shorter documents.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Dataset description section
  Limitations: Scope of limitation focused on document length, overlooking other factors like linguistic complexity or domain-specific nuances.
  Exact Quote: The fact that English documents are longer than those in Yorùbá makes the task easier for Yorùbá.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Acknowledged limitations in dataset comparability due to length differences provide valuable context for understanding performance disparities, yet a more thorough examination of additional influencing factors is needed.
Key Limitations: Limited consideration of qualitative aspects and linguistic complexities; generalization of task difficulty based on length alone.
