Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Different prediction scenarios yield distinct causal tracing (CT) results if studied in isolation.
Location: Section 5 Conclusion
Exact Quote: We find that different prediction scenarios yield distinct CT results if studied in isolation.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The combined plot of exact fact recall, heuristics recall, and guesswork samples generally reproduces the same CT results as observed in previous work, thereby supporting the conclusion that (last subject token, mid layer) MLP states are decisive.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2, Aggregations of prediction scenarios
  Limitations: This evidence may be influenced by the exact fact recall samples generally corresponding to higher prediction confidences.
  Exact Quote: The combined plot of exact fact recall, heuristics recall, and guesswork samples in Figure 3e generally reproduces the same CT results as observed in previous work, and thereby supports the same conclusion, i.e. (last subject token, mid layer) MLP states are decisive.

- Evidence Text: Exact fact recall results show a clear peak in AIE in (last subject token, mid layer) MLP states and all other states reduce in relative effect, fundamentally different from other scenarios.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2 Results, Exact fact recall
  Limitations: These conclusions are specific to the datasets and models tested and may not generalize to all types of language models.
  Exact Quote: Exact fact recall results Figure 3d show a clear peak in AIE in (last subject token, mid layer) MLP states and all other states (last token, other subject tokens) reduce in relative effect.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The distinct patterns observed in causal tracing results across different prediction scenarios, especially between exact fact recall and other scenarios, validate the claim.
Key Limitations: The evaluation is constrained by the experimental setup and the specific datasets used for testing.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: CT results are not representative of the dataset as a whole if it contains examples of different prediction scenarios.
Location: Section 5 Conclusion
Exact Quote: CT results are not representative of the dataset as a whole if it contains examples of different prediction scenarios.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Aggregations of CT results across multiple prediction scenarios are not representative of each studied sample due to the dominance of exact fact recall samples in non-normalized results.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: G Normalization effects on causal tracing results
  Limitations: The conclusion is derived from the analysis of aggregated results and normalization effects, which might not capture the full complexity of prediction scenario influences.
  Exact Quote: Aggregations of CT results across multiple prediction scenarios are not representative of each studied sample.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence supports the claim by showing the impact of mixing prediction scenarios on the representativeness of CT results, though the evidence is based on analysis within a specific methodological framework.
Key Limitations: Findings are dependent on the specific computational and normalization techniques used in the study.
