Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: Introduction of XAA and TSA improves FAME-ViL's performance across diverse tasks in both single and multi-task settings.
Location: 4.2 Ablation study on architecture
Exact Quote: we find that TSA and XAA can bring in 3%-6% relative improvements for XMR and TGIR.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The performance improvement is quantified with and without the novel architecture components, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 4. Ablation study and further analysis
  Limitations: Assessment could be influenced by dataset characteristics and selection.
  Exact Quote: STL + TSA + XAA (FAME-ViL(ST)) +15.96 69.99 +5.56 55.47 +6.94 90.27 -0.07 63.67 -0.05 69.85 +3.10

- Evidence Text: XAA and TSA have additive effects, achieving better performance in combination than individually.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Ablation study descriptions
  Limitations: Performances measured in isolation may not fully represent their combined efficacy.
  Exact Quote: When TSA and XAA work together, the model can achieve better relative performance than the sum of their gains

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The specific improvements in various tasks due to TSA and XAA, as demonstrated in the ablation study, strongly support the claim.
Key Limitations: Investigation primarily confined to specific settings and a limited set of tasks.

Exact Quote: FAME-ViL again achieves state-of-the-art performance with a clear margin.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: TGIR results on FashionIQ demonstrate FAME-ViL's superior performance metrics.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 2. Text-Guided Image Retrieval (TGIR) results
  Limitations: Results are dataset-specific.
  Exact Quote: FAME-ViL 42.19 67.38 47.64 68.79 50.69 73.07 58.29

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: FAME-ViL's top-ranking results in TGIR, as shown in Table 2, convincingly support the claim of advanced performance.
