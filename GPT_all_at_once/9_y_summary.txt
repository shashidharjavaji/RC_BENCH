Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Multimodal neurons in text-only transformer MLPs translate image semantics into language.
Location: Conclusion section
Exact Quote: We find multimodal neurons in text-only transformer MLPs and show that these neurons consistently translate image semantics into language.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Multimodal neurons are better at segmenting objects in images than randomly selected neurons, and ablating multimodal neurons degrades image caption content significantly.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Sections 3.2 and 3.3
  Limitations: Evaluation is based on a single multimodal model, LiMBeR-BEIT.
  Exact Quote: Across 12 COCO categories, the receptive fields of multimodal neurons better segment the concept in each image than randomly sampled neurons in the same layers. Ablating the same number of top-scoring units decreases token probability by 80% on average.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Evidence supports the claim, but analysis is conducted on a single model which might limit generalizability.
Key Limitations: Study on a single multimodal model; further investigation across other models needed for generalizability.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Soft-prompt inputs to the language model do not map onto interpretable tokens in the output vocabulary.
Location: Conclusion section
Exact Quote: Soft-prompt inputs to the language model do not map onto interpretable tokens in the output vocabulary.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Decoded image prompts show no significant difference from random embeddings based on comparison metrics such as CLIPScore and BERTScore.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.1
  Limitations: May not capture the nuanced ways in which soft-prompts contribute to model performance.
  Exact Quote: Real and random prompts are negligibly different, confirming that inputs to GPT-J do not readily encode interpretable semantics.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The direct evaluation of soft-prompt input semantics supports the claim effectively.
Key Limitations: The approach may overlook indirect effects of soft-prompts on model performance.
