Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: Integrated gradients is symmetry-preserving and unique in this property among path methods.
Location: Section 4.2
Exact Quote: Integrated gradients is the unique path method that is symmetry-preserving.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Proof provided demonstrating integrated gradients' unique property of being symmetry-preserving.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: The proof is abstract and may not easily translate to intuitive understanding without a strong mathematical background.
  Exact Quote: The proof is provided in Appendix A.

- Evidence Text: Comparison to Shapley-Shubik method, highlighting the computational efficiency and operational simplicity of integrated gradients.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Compares a specific aspect (computational efficiency) without discussing possible merits of Shapley-Shubik in terms of fairness or distributional attributions.
  Exact Quote: If we allow averaging over the attributions from multiple paths, then are other methods that satisfy all the axioms in Theorem 1.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported both by mathematical proof of symmetry preservation and practical consideration of computational efficiency, offering a rounded perspective on the advantages of integrated gradients.
Key Limitations: The evaluation does not fully explore scenarios where other methods might offer advantages, such as different attribution requirements or valuations.

Claim 2:
Type: contribution
Statement: The axiomatic approach helps in systematically addressing potential misbehaviors in attribution methods.
Location: Section 3
Exact Quote: To compensate for this short-coming, we take an axiomatic approach.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Identified two fundamental axioms that attribution methods must satisfy.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 2
  Limitations: Does not empirically validate how the axioms mitigate misbehavior in real-world applications.
  Exact Quote: We identify two axioms that every attribution method must satisfy.

- Evidence Text: Demonstrates the axiomatic approach by developing the integrated gradients method that adheres to the identified axioms.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3
  Limitations: While demonstrating practical application, it doesn't compare with empirical results from other attribution methods.
  Exact Quote: In Section 3, we use the axioms to identify a new method, called integrated gradients.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is theoretically well-founded through the establishment of key axioms and their application in developing a new method, presenting a logical progression from problem identification to solution.
Key Limitations: Lack of empirical comparison or validation makes it hard to measure the practical superiority of the axiomatic approach over empirical approaches.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: contribution
Statement: Integrated gradients attributions can be visualized to demonstrate the importance of features in a deep network's predictions.
Location: Section 6.2
Exact Quote: Feature importance explanations are important for this network as retina specialists may use it to build trust in the network's predictions.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Visualization of integrated gradients for diabetic retinopathy prediction highlights the specific regions in retinal images contributing to the network's output.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6.2
  Limitations: Specific to visual models, may not demonstrate the method's applicability or limitations in non-visual contexts.
  Exact Quote: We use integrated gradients to study feature importance for this network.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Evidence through visualization aligns closely with the claim, illustrating how integrated gradients can reveal important features contributing to a model's predictions, potentially aiding in the interpretability of deep learning models.
Key Limitations: The focus on a specific application case does not address the method's broader applicability across different types of deep learning models or tasks.
