Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: CQCC significantly outperforms MFCC in classifying neurodegenerative disorders using speech signals.
Location: Introduction/Abstract/Conclusions
Exact Quote: CQCC, when integrated with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers, significantly outperform MFCC

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: CQCC achieved the highest classification accuracy with Random Forest at 99%.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Experimental Results
  Limitations: Comparison limited to two classifiers.
  Exact Quote: Among the features analyzed, CQCC achieved the highest classification accuracy, with the Random Forest classifier attaining an exceptional 99%

- Evidence Text: LDA plots show clearer separation for CQCC features compared to MFCC, indicating stronger discriminative power.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Feature Visualization
  Limitations: Visual analysis may not capture all nuances of feature performance.
  Exact Quote: LDA plot of CQCC features exhibits a clearer separation, especially between the ALS and Parkinsonâ€™s disease classes

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Evidence includes both quantitative results and qualitative observations supporting the superiority of CQCC over MFCC.
Key Limitations: Studies focused on specific neurodegenerative diseases; broader applicability remains to be explored.

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: The form-invariance property of CQT enhances the robustness of CQCC for neurodegenerative disorder classification.
Location: Methodology
Exact Quote: The form-invariance property of the Constant Q Transform (CQT), which ensures consistent feature representation across varying pitch and tonal conditions

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: CQCC utilizes geometrically spaced frequency bins, offering superior spectrotemporal resolution.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Methodology
  Limitations: Claims are based on theoretical benefits without direct empirical comparison to non-form-invariant features.
  Exact Quote: CQCC leverages geometrically spaced frequency bins to provide superior spectrotemporal resolution

- Evidence Text: Pitch and tonal consistency across variations enhances classification robustness.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Abstract/Introduction
  Limitations: Lack of empirical data explicitly demonstrating improved robustness due to form-invariance.
  Exact Quote: CQCC is underpinned by the form-invariance property of the CQT

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Theoretical underpinnings of CQCC's methodology suggest increased robustness, though empirical evidence specific to form-invariance is less direct.
Key Limitations: Further empirical validation needed to directly assess the impact of form-invariance on classification robustness.
