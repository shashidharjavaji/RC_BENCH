Enhanced performance metrics in comparison to various baselines, coupled with efficient parameter use, validate the superiority of the proposed strategies. The novel use of class tokens for explicit grouping, the reduction of false positives, and the improved discriminability and compactness of learned features further solidify the argument.",
