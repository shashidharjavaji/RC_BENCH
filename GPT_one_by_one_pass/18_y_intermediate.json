The approach leverages off-the-shelf, general-purpose retrievers to yield surprisingly large gains across different model sizes and text corpora. Further improvements can be achieved by tailoring document selection processes specific to the LM task, such as document reranking, demonstrating the framework's flexibility and effectiveness in enhancing LM performance without complicating deployment.",

This is further evidenced by better performance metrics across diverse datasets and model sizes, including direct comparisons where enhanced models outperform larger unenhanced models. The methodological approach combines conceptual simplicity with practical effectiveness, leveraging existing models and retrievers without necessitating modifications, thereby validating the claim through empirical results.",

Additionally, while the framework improves LM performance, the inherent limitations of the underlying LMs and retrievers, such as biases in the training data or retrieval inaccuracies, remain unaddressed. The approach also presupposes the availability and effectiveness of suitable documents for retrieval, which might not always be the case.",
