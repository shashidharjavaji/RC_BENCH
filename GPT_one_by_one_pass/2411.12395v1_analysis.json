Using this, we initiated a fine-tuning job on OpenAI\u2019s fine-tuning API which returned a model checkpoint. The GT Answer Overlap for the 4o-mini model is 0.643 while that for the fine-tuned 4o-mini model is 0.626. Therefore, we see that fine-tuning, at least at this small scale, does not provide any improvement in LLM performance on ambiguous questions."
