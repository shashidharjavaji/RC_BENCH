Given the novel application and lack of quantitative metrics for evaluation, the reliance on qualitative comparisons provides a strong initial indication of success. The consistency and quality of the generated images, as compared to the outputs from text descriptions, underline FuseMix's effectiveness.",
                "limitations": "The authors acknowledge the limitation of lacking quantitative analysis for the audio-to-image conversion task. This gap is primarily due to the absence of established metrics suitable for this innovative use case. Furthermore, the evidence is based on qualitative assessments rather than a comprehensive quantitative evaluation, which might limit the generalizability and verifiability of the findings.",

Demonstrated through examples where audio prompts lead to high-quality image generation comparable to their text-prompt counterparts, the claim is convincingly supported. However, the absence of quantitative measures leaves room for future work to establish more rigorous evaluations.",
