Likewise, there is also a negative transfer for the XAA-equipped CLIP model (L7), albeit with a slight increase in performance. This problem can be well solved using our TSA, with an overall 4%\u223c6% improvement (L5 vs. L7 and L6 vs. L8), even though only a few extra task-specific parameters are introduced."
