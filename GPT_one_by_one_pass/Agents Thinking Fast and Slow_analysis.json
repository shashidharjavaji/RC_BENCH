This is analogous to behavioral science dual-System approach, with System 1 always being on while System 2 operates at a fraction of its capacity. Similarly, the Talker is always on and interacting with the environment, while the Reasoner updates beliefs informing the Talker only when the Talker waits for it, or can read it from memory. This division of labor works well most of the time, as the Talker is typically very good at what it does: it can automatically fetch information from memory, effectively priming its underlying model to respond well to familiar situations. However, the framework has limitations. The Talker operates with a more outdated view of the world, which has inherent biases, and can sometimes answer easier questions than the ones asked. Also, it has little understanding of complex problem solving and planning.
