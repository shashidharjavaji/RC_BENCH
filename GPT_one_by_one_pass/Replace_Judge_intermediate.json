We find that PoLL rankings correlate better with the ground truth, particularly at the top of the ranked list. We can clearly observe intra-model bias as the GPT-4 judge ranks another GPT-4 variant in position 2, higher than its actual position 4, which is in line with previous works that have also observed GPT-4\u2019s preference for its own generations."
