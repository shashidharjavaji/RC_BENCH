EUREKA\u2019s generality is made possible through three key algorithmic design choices: environment as context, evolutionary search, and reward reflection. First, by taking the environment source code as context, EUREKA can zero-shot generate executable reward functions from the backbone coding LLM (GPT-4). Then, EUREKA substantially improves the quality of its rewards by performing evolutionary search, iteratively proposing batches of reward candidates and refining the most promising ones within the LLM context window. This in-context improvement is made effective via reward reflection, a textual summary of the reward quality based on policy training statistics that enables automated and targeted reward editing; see Fig. 3 for an example of EUREKA zero-shot reward as well as various improvements accumulated during its optimization."
