Controllable Test Cases: The length of each test case can be finely tuned - by adjusting the number and length of text segments in TSort and altering the number of distractor options in BestAnswer. 2. Necessity for Full-Text Comprehension: Successful completion of both tasks mandates complete reading and understanding of the provided text. 3. Precise Accuracy Measurement: The design of these tasks allows for unambiguous accuracy calculation."
