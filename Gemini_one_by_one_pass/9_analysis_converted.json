Otherwise, the LLM may produce hallucinated answers. To this end, we test whether the correct answers to domain-specific questions can be predicted solely based on the activity of the associated neurons. Since we harvest QR neurons for queries in different subject domains, we can group all neurons for a domain to obtain a set of domain-specific neurons. We experiment on a specifically constructed MMLU (Hendrycks et al. 2020) validation set with a different set of questions than those used to determine the QR neurons (see Section B in the SM for details on our experimental strategy). The results are summarised in Table 6. We observe that the accuracy of the neuron-based predictions is very close to the accuracy of the prompt-based method of using the entire model (the used templates are shown in Table A3 in the SM). This suggests that the activity of identified neurons can reflect the model\u2019s reasoning process to some extent. Investigating how this finding could be leveraged in applications like fact-checking and hallucination detection presents a promising line of future work.",
