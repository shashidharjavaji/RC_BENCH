Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: AutoAIS is fit-for-purpose as a development metric at the aggregate level.
Location: section 5.5
Exact Quote: AutoAIS is fit-for-purpose as a development metric at the aggregate level (provided it is not used as a system component).

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Strong correlation between system AIS and AutoAIS scores, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.96
  Strength: strong
  Location: section 5.5
  Limitations: Correlation may not hold at the instance level
  Exact Quote: Correlation between system AIS and AutoAIS scores is remarkably strong, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.96 (Figure 3).

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: AutoAIS shows a strong correlation with human evaluation of AIS at the system level, indicating its potential as a development metric.
Key Limitations: May not be reliable at the instance level

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: Retrieve-then-read approaches achieve the strongest performance on the evaluation.
Location: section 6
Exact Quote: Retrieve-then-read approaches achieve the strongest performance on our evaluation, but require full use of a traditional training set.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 2 shows that Retrieve-then-read (RTR) systems consistently achieve higher AIS scores compared to post-hoc retrieval systems
  Strength: strong
  Location: section 5.2
  Limitations: Evaluation is based on a specific dataset (Natural Questions) and may not generalize to other tasks or datasets
  Exact Quote: None

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Empirical results demonstrate that retrieve-then-read systems outperform post-hoc retrieval systems in terms of AIS scores.
Key Limitations: Generalizability to other datasets and tasks is uncertain

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: methodology
Statement: Post-hoc attribution appears to be a viable architecture for future work, but remains challenging.
Location: section 6
Exact Quote: Post-hoc attribution appears to be a viable architecture for future work, but remains challenging.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Post-hoc retrieval systems achieve lower AIS scores than retrieve-then-read systems
  Strength: moderate
  Location: section 5.2
  Limitations: Results may vary depending on the specific post-hoc retrieval approach and dataset used
  Exact Quote: None

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: While post-hoc attribution shows promise, it faces challenges in achieving performance comparable to retrieve-then-read approaches.
Key Limitations: Feasibility and effectiveness may vary depending on the implementation and dataset
