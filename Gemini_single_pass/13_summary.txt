Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Dense passage retrieval outperforms sparse vector space models, such as TF-IDF or BM25, in open-domain question answering.
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: In this work, we show that retrieval can be practically implemented using dense representations alone, where embeddings are learned from a small number of questions and passages by a simple dual-encoder framework. When evaluated on a wide range of open-domain QA datasets, our dense retriever outperforms a strong Lucene-BM25 system greatly by 9%-19% absolute in terms of top-20 passage retrieval accuracy, and helps our end-to-end QA system establish new state-of-the-art on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks.

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: The proposed dense retriever is trained using a simple dual-encoder architecture that optimizes the inner product similarity between question and passage vectors.
Location: Section 3.2 Training
