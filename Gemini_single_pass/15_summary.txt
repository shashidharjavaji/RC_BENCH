Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Contrary to the prevalent practice of exclusively employing greedy decoding, exploring alternative top-k tokens in the decoding space reveals the natural existence of reasoning paths within these models.
Location: section 5
Exact Quote: Contrary to the prevalent practice of exclusively employing greedy decoding, exploring alternative top-k tokens in the decoding space reveals the natural existence of reasoning paths within these models.

Evidence:
Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: No
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is an empirical observation made by the authors and is not directly supported by specific experimental results or data.
Key Limitations: The claim is based on observations made on a limited number of language models and tasks, and may not generalize to all language models or tasks.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: The presence of a CoT reasoning path correlates with increased model confidence in decoding its final answer.
Location: section 5
Exact Quote: Furthermore, our empirical observations highlight that the presence of a CoT reasoning path correlates with increased model confidence in decoding its final answer.
