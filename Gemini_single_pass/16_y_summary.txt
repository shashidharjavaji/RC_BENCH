Statement: LLMs offer promising solutions for XBRL analysis, but they also face challenges.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: While LLMs offer promising solutions, they also face challenges in XBRL analysis.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: LLMs may struggle with the highly structured nature of XBRL data and the need for domain-specific financial knowledge.
  Strength: weak
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: This is just one potential challenge that LLMs may face; it is not clear how well they will perform in practice.
  Exact Quote: Li and Zhang [27] point out that LLMs may struggle with the highly structured nature of XBRL data and the need for domain-specific financial knowledge.

- Evidence Text: LLMs may have potential issues with interpreting numerical data and complex financial calculations in XBRL reports.
  Strength: weak
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: This is just one potential challenge that LLMs may face; it is not clear how well they will perform in practice.
  Exact Quote: Chen and Liu [9] highlight potential issues with LLMsâ€™ interpretation of numerical data and complex financial calculations in XBRL reports.

- Evidence Text: LLMs may raise concerns about the ethical implications and potential biases in LLM-based financial analysis.
  Strength: weak
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: This is just one potential challenge that LLMs may face; it is not clear how well they will perform in practice.
  Exact Quote: Moreover, Wang and Johnson [50] raise concerns about the ethical implications and potential biases in LLM-based financial analysis.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is supported by several references to the literature, which identify potential challenges that LLMs may face in XBRL analysis.
Key Limitations: It is not clear how well LLMs will perform in practice; the identified challenges may not be significant in real-world applications.

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: Financial mathematics provides essential tools for calculating critical financial metrics in XBRL report analysis.
Location: Mathematics and Financial Mathematics
Exact Quote: In XBRL report analysis, financial mathematics provides essential tools for calculating critical financial metrics.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Core financial formulas like Net Present Value (NPV), Future Value (FV), and Present Value (PV) play an integral role.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Mathematics and Financial Mathematics
  Limitations: These are just a few examples of financial formulas that are used in XBRL report analysis; there are many others.
  Exact Quote: Core financial formulas like Net Present Value (NPV), Future Value (FV), and Present Value (PV) play an integral role.

- Evidence Text: NPV evaluates investment profitability by calculating the difference between discounted cash inflows and outflows.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Mathematics and Financial Mathematics
  Limitations: This is just one example of how financial formulas are used in XBRL report analysis; there are many other applications.
  Exact Quote: NPV evaluates investment profitability by calculating the difference between discounted cash inflows and outflows [18].

- Evidence Text: FV and PV formulas determine investment values over time and at present, respectively.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Mathematics and Financial Mathematics
  Limitations: This is just one example of how financial formulas are used in XBRL report analysis; there are many other applications.
  Exact Quote: FV and PV formulas determine investment values over time and at present, respectively [28].

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported by several specific examples of financial formulas that are used in XBRL report analysis.
Key Limitations: The claim does not provide an exhaustive list of all financial formulas that are used in XBRL report analysis.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: performance
Statement: LLMs demonstrate moderate proficiency in financial terminology but encounter difficulties with specific XBRL report interpretations.
Location: Results
Exact Quote: LLMs demonstrate moderate proficiency in financial terminology but encounter difficulties with specific XBRL report interpretations.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The best-performing model, Qwen2-7B, only achieves an 81% score in XBRL Term and a mere 51% in Domain Query to XBRL Reports.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results
  Limitations: This is just one example of the performance of LLMs on XBRL report analysis tasks; the performance may vary depending on the specific task and model.
  Exact Quote: Performance in this category is relatively better, yet the accuracy rates still necessitate improvement. Even the best-performing model, Qwen2-7B, only achieves an 81% score in XBRL Term and a mere 51% in Domain Query to XBRL Reports.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is supported by specific examples of the performance of LLMs on XBRL report analysis tasks.
Key Limitations: The claim does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of LLMs on all XBRL report analysis tasks.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 4:
Type: performance
Statement: LLMs demonstrate significant limitations in handling mathematical data and financial calculations.
Location: Results
Exact Quote: LLMs demonstrate significant limitations in handling mathematical data and financial calculations.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The best-performing model, Llama3-8B, only achieves 38% accuracy in Financial Formula Calculation and 24% in Numeric Query to XBRL Reports task.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results
  Limitations: This is just one example of the performance of LLMs on XBRL report analysis tasks; the performance may vary depending on the specific task and model.
  Exact Quote: The performances in this category are particularly concerning. Even the best-performing model, Llama3-8B, only achieves 38% accuracy in Financial Formula Calculation and 24% in Numeric Query to XBRL Reports task.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
