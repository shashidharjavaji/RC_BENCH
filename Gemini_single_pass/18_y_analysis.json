It is evident that reranking yielded consistently better results than simply taking the first result returned by the retriever.\\n\\nTable 3 shows that a small LM (GPT-2 117M) can be used to rerank the documents for all larger GPT-2 models, with roughly the same performance as having each LM perform reranking for itself, supporting the applicability of this method for LMs that are only accessible via an API.\\n\\nNext, we trained a reranker to choose one of the top-k documents retrieved by BM25. We refer to this approach as Predictive Reranking, since the reranker learns to choose which document will help in \u2018\u2018predicting\u2019\u2019 the upcoming text. For this process, we assume availability of training data from the target corpus. Our reranker is a classifier that gets a prefix x\u2264s\u00b7j and a document di (for i \u2208 [k]), and produces a scalar f (x\u2264s\u00b7j, di) that should resemble the relevance of di for the continuation of x\u2264s\u00b7j. We then normalize these relevance scores:\\n\\nprank(di|x\u2264s\u00b7j) = ke\u2212exp(f (x\u2264s\u00b7j, di))i\u2032=1 [exp(f [(x\u2264s\u00b7j, di\u2032)])]\\n\\nand choose the document d\u02c6i such that\\n\u02c6i = arg maxprank(di|x\u2264s\u00b7j).\\ni\u2208[k]\\nResults Table 1 shows the result of our predictive reranker, trained on WikiText-103. Specifically, we trained it with data produced by GPT-2 110M (S), and tested its effectiveness for all GPT-2 models. We observed significant gains obtained from Predictive Reranking. For example, the perplexity of GPT-2 110M (S) improved from 29.6 to 26.8, and that of GPT-2 1.5B (XL) improved from 16.6 to 15.4. This trend held for the other two models as well. Overall, these results demonstrate that training a reranker with domain-specific data was more effective than zero-shot reranking (Section 6.1). Note that these results\u2014while impressive\u2014still leave room for further improvements, compared to the top-16 BM25 oracle results (see Figure 7). Moreover, the oracle results themselves can be improved by retrieving k > 16 documents via a BM25 retriever, or by training stronger retrievers dedicated to the RALM task. We leave this direction for future work."
