Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: The research team found using self-correction skill does not directly lead to valid plans but does contribute to the overall plan quality, as reflected in the enhanced executability rate.
Location: Section 5
Exact Quote: They do contribute to the overall plan quality, as reflected in the enhanced executability rate. This indicates progress towards more coherent plans, despite not directly leading to valid plans.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Executability rate shows a slight improvement when using self-correction skill.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.4
  Limitations: Conclusions may not apply to all planning tasks.
  Exact Quote: However, the strategy gave a slight improvement in executability rate (e.g., row 10 vs. 11), suggesting its ability to enhance the coherence of generated sequences.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence supports the claim that self-correction skill improves executability rate, suggesting progress towards more coherent plans.
Key Limitations: The study may not have explored all potential factors contributing to plan quality, and the findings may not generalize to all planning domains.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: The RL training process led to a noticeable performance gain in OOD cases.
Location: Section 4.7
Exact Quote: This however lead to a noticeable performance gain in OOD cases.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The validity rate on the ‘long’ test set increased from 34.8% to 41.5% (a 6.7% increase) and the executability rate increased from 42.3% to 53.6% (9.0%).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.7
  Limitations: The results may be specific to the dataset used.
  Exact Quote: Despite the limited training data and suboptimal rewards achieved on this subset, RL boosted the validity rate on the ‘long’ test set from 34.8% to 41.5% (a 6.7% increase) and the executability rate from 42.3% to 53.6% (9.0%).

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence provides strong support for the claim that RL training led to a significant performance gain in OOD cases.
Key Limitations: The generalizability of these findings to other datasets may need further exploration.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: The State CoT strategy demonstrates efficacy in other reasoning tasks, where these tasks typically require solution steps that align with the training data distribution.
Location: Section 4.5
Exact Quote: Importantly, the ‘unseen’ test set retains the same plan length distribution as the training set. Thus, we posit that the State CoT’s ability to enhance the model’s understanding of state transition dynamics may likely be limited to the plan length distribution it encountered during training.

Evidence:
Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: No
Robustness: low
Confidence Level: low
Justification: The claim is based on a hypothesis and lacks concrete evidence.
Key Limitations: The claim is speculative and does not provide empirical evidence to support its validity.

--------------------------------------------------
