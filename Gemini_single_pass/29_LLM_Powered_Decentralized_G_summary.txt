Claim 4:
Type: methodology
Statement: The schemas are built around three core components: (i) Reflection, which enables agents to review recent actions.
Location: Section 3.3
Exact Quote: The schemas are built around three core components: (i) Reflection, which enables agents to review recent actions, summarize outcomes, and reflect on lessons learned to adjust future strategies; (ii) Goal, which tracks both current and long-term objectives, including sub-goals and progress updates, helping the agent stay focused and break down tasks into manageable steps; and (iii) NextAc**tion, which determines the agent’s upcoming actions and** the reasoning behind them, evaluating prerequisites and ensuring alignment with both short-term and long-term goals.
