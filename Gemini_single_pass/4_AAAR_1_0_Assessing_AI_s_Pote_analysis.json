For example,\\nSi, Yang, and Hashimoto (2024) conducted a large-scale\\nhuman investigation on LLM-generated research ideas and\\nfound that LLMs can generate novel ideas compared with\\nhumans while lacking feasibility. Du et al. (2024) found that\\nwhile LLMs are effective at summarizing papers, they tend\\nto overly trust the authors\u2019 claimed strengths and struggle\\nto identify weaknesses specific to the paper. Furthermore,\\nsome works try to employ LLMs to solve more complicated\\nresearch tasks that are composed of multiple steps (Li et al.\\n2024, 2023a; Tang et al. 2023). Notably, Lu et al.
