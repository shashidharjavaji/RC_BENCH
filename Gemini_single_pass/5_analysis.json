In this work, we disentangle and detail different prediction scenarios for which LMs can be expected to show distinct behaviors. We identify four such scenarios (see Figure 1): 1) Generic language modeling, when the model does not respond with facts, such as when generating a story. 2) Guesswork, when the model responds with a fact but is uncertain. 3) Heuristics recall, when the model uses shallow heuristics, e.g. that people with Korean-sounding names are more likely to live in Korea. And finally: 4) Exact fact recall, when the model has indeed memorized the correct answer and recalls it for the prediction."
