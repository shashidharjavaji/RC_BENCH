Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: The proposed JMRI framework outperforms existing visual grounding methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: Despite using a transformer to enhance multimodal correlation and inference effectiveness, vision and language are treated independently and processed distantly until later fusion. Although this fusion may easily get two modalities connected, the resulting visual and linguistic features cannot be unified into the same semantic space, leading to a lower and upper bound for grounding. Therefore, we argue it is necessary to perform the intermodal alignment before deep fusion.
