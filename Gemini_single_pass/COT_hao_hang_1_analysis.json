For the traditional few-shot prompting method used in Brown et al. (2020), it works poorly on tasks that require reasoning abilities, and often does not improve substantially with increasing language model scale (Rae et al., 2021). In this paper, we combine the strengths of these two ideas in a way that avoids their limitations. Specifically, we explore the ability of language models to perform few-shot prompting for reasoning tasks, given a prompt that consists of triples: input, chain of thought, output."
