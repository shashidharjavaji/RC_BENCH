Claim 4:
Type: methodology
Statement: A simple method called chain-of-thought prompting can elicit chain-of-thought reasoning in sufficiently large language models.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: Both of the above ideas, however, have key limitations. For rationale-augmented training and finetuning methods, it is costly to create a large set of high quality rationales, which is much more complicated than simple input–output pairs used in normal machine learning. For the traditional few-shot prompting method used in Brown et al. (2020), it works poorly on tasks that require reasoning abilities, and often does not improve substantially with increasing language model scale (Rae et al., 2021). In this paper, we combine the strengths of these two ideas in a way that avoids their limitations. Specifically, we explore the ability of language models to perform few-shot prompting for reasoning tasks, given a prompt that consists of triples: input, chain of thought, output.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Chain-of-thought prompting involves providing a few chain of thought demonstrations as exemplars in prompting.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Abstract
  Limitations: The number and quality of chain of thought demonstrations required is not specified.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 9:
Type: performance
Statement: Chain-of-thought prompting facilitates length generalization beyond seen chains of thought for language models of sufficient scale.
Location: section 5
Exact Quote: As for the OOD evaluations, standard prompting fails for both tasks. With chain-of-thought prompting, language models achieve upward scaling curves (though performance is lower than in the in-domain setting).

Claim 11:
Type: performance
Statement: Chain-of-thought prompting facilitates generalization to longer sequences in two symbolic reasoning tasks.
Location: section 5
Exact Quote: As the construction of these symbolic reasoning tasks is well-defined, for each task we consider an in-domain test set for which examples had the same number of steps as the training/few-shot exemplars, as well as an out-of-domain (OOD) test set, for which evaluation examples had more steps than those in the exemplars. For last letter concatenation, the model only sees exemplars of names with two words, and then performs last letter concatenation on names with 3 and 4 words.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The model only sees exemplars of names with two words, and then performs last letter concatenation on names with 3 and 4 words.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: section 5

Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence provides a specific example of how chain-of-thought prompting enables generalization to longer sequences in the last letter concatenation task, but it does not cover the coin flip task or provide a general assessment of performance across multiple symbolic reasoning tasks.
