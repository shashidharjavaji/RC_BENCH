Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: EUREKA outperforms expert human-engineered rewards on 83% of tasks across 29 environments, with 52% average normalized improvement
Location: Abstract and Section 4.3
Exact Quote: EUREKA outperforms expert human-engineered rewards on 83% of the tasks, leading to an average normalized improvement of 52%

  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Limited to simulated environments, may not generalize to real robots
  Exact Quote: Notably, EUREKA exceeds or performs on par to human level on all Isaac tasks and 15 out of 20 tasks on Dexterity

- Evidence Text: Quantitative results shown in Figure 4 comparing EUREKA against Human and L2R baselines
  Strength: strong
  Location: Figure 4
  Limitations: Specific metrics and evaluation protocol details not fully explained
  Exact Quote: Figure 4: EUREKA outperforms Human and L2R across all tasks

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Comprehensive evaluation across diverse environments with clear metrics and baselines
Key Limitations: Limited to simulated environments, real-world performance unknown

Claim 2:
Type: contribution
Statement: EUREKA enables pen spinning capabilities for the first time on a simulated Shadow Hand through curriculum learning
Location: Section 4.3
Exact Quote: Eureka fine-tuning quickly adapts the policy to successfully spin the pen for many cycles in a row

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Training curves showing successful pen spinning through curriculum learning approach
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Figure 7
  Limitations: Only shown in simulation, physical feasibility not demonstrated
  Exact Quote: Figure 7: EUREKA can be flexibly combined with curriculum learning to acquire complex dexterous skills

- Evidence Text: Comparison showing direct learning from scratch fails
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Limited ablation studies on curriculum design choices
  Exact Quote: neither pre-trained or learning-from-scratch policies can complete even a single cycle of pen spinning

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Clear demonstration of capability through controlled comparisons
Key Limitations: Only demonstrated in simulation, curriculum design choices not fully explored

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: methodology
Statement: EUREKA can effectively improve upon human-designed reward functions when used as initialization
Location: Section 4.4
Exact Quote: regardless of the quality of the human rewards, EUREKA improves and benefits from human rewards as EUREKA (Human Init.) is uniformly better than both EUREKA and Human on all tasks

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Results showing improved performance when initializing with human rewards
  Strength: strong
  Location: Figure 8
  Limitations: Limited to small set of selected tasks
  Exact Quote: EUREKA (Human Init.) is uniformly better than both EUREKA and Human on all tasks

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Clear improvement demonstrated but on limited task subset
Key Limitations: Only tested on selected subset of tasks, generality not fully established

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 4:
Type: result
Statement: EUREKA generates novel reward functions that are often weakly correlated with human rewards while outperforming them
Location: Section 4.3
Exact Quote: EUREKA mostly generates weakly correlated reward functions that outperform the human ones

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Correlation analysis between EUREKA and human rewards
  Strength: strong
  Location: Figure 6
  Limitations: Analysis limited to Isaac tasks
  Exact Quote: In a few cases, EUREKA rewards are even negatively correlated with human rewards but perform significantly better

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Clear quantitative analysis of reward function correlations
Key Limitations: Analysis limited to Isaac tasks, correlation metrics could be more detailed
