Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Simple training-free disambiguation methods improve LLM performance on ambiguous questions
Location: Section V Results and Discussion
Exact Quote: using simple disambiguating prompts improves performance over the naive setting, implying that simple prompt-based, training-free approaches may be useful in improving LLM performance for ambiguous queries

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: GPT-4o GT Answer Overlap improves from 0.759 (naive) to 0.789 (context disambiguation)
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Table I
  Limitations: Limited to two specific LLM models, relatively small improvement magnitude
  Exact Quote: GT Answer Overlap ↑: Naive: 0.759, via context: 0.789

- Evidence Text: GPT-4o-mini shows similar improvement pattern
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Table II
  Limitations: Small improvement magnitude
  Exact Quote: GT Answer Overlap ↑: Naive: 0.692, via context: 0.71

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Consistent improvements shown across two different models, though improvements are modest
Key Limitations: Limited model selection, relatively small improvements, no statistical significance testing

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Small-scale fine-tuning does not improve LLM performance on ambiguous questions
Location: Section V Results and Discussion - RQ2
Exact Quote: we see that fine-tuning, at least at this small scale, does not provide any improvement in LLM performance on ambiguous questions

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Fine-tuned model performs worse than baseline
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section V
  Limitations: Only tested on GPT-4o-mini, very limited fine-tuning dataset size
  Exact Quote: The GT Answer Overlap for the 4o-mini model is 0.643 while that for the fine-tuned 4o-mini model is 0.626

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: No
Robustness: low
Confidence Level: low
Justification: While evidence shows degraded performance, the extremely limited fine-tuning approach (only 50 examples) makes it premature to make broad claims about fine-tuning effectiveness
Key Limitations: Very small fine-tuning dataset, tested on only one model, no exploration of different fine-tuning approaches

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: Lower temperature values do not significantly improve LLM performance on ambiguous questions
Location: Section V Results and Discussion - RQ3
Exact Quote: we see that although lower temperature (0.2 instead of 1.0, in this case) seem to have minor improvements in some cases, the difference is not that significant

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Visual comparison in Figure 4 showing minimal differences
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Figure 4
  Limitations: Only tested two temperature values, no statistical analysis
  Exact Quote: Comparison of GT Answer Overlap for GPT 4o and 4o-mini for both high and low temperatures. High = 1.0, low = 0.2

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Visual evidence supports claim of minimal impact, though more rigorous analysis would strengthen conclusion
Key Limitations: Limited temperature values tested, lack of statistical analysis, no exploration of interaction effects
