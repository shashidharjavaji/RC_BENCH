Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: Intermediate layers consistently outperform the final layer across different architectures for downstream tasks
Location: Section 4.1
Exact Quote: Our findings indicate that intermediate layers consistently outperform the final layer across all three architectures (Table 1). Selecting the best-performing intermediate layer yields at least a 2% improvement in average accuracy compared to using the last layer.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Performance comparison across models showing improvement with intermediate layers
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: Limited to three specific architectures
  Exact Quote: LLM2Vec 8B: 64.7% vs 66.8%, Pythia 410M: 49.8% vs 53.3%, Mamba 130M: 46.9% vs 50.9%

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Clear quantitative evidence across multiple models showing consistent improvement
Key Limitations: Limited model selection, specific task types

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Transformer architectures show more pronounced changes in representation quality metrics compared to SSMs
Location: Section 4.3.1
Exact Quote: Overall, these metric shifts are more pronounced in Pythia than in Mamba, suggesting that Pythia undergoes stronger representational transformations at intermediate depths.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Comparison of entropy and LiDAR metrics
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.3.1
  Limitations: Based on specific metrics that may not capture all aspects of representation quality
  Exact Quote: For entropy and LiDAR, Pythia shows a pronounced decrease at intermediate layers, suggesting greater information compression and consolidation. In contrast, Mamba maintains more stable values

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Multiple metrics show consistent pattern, supported by visualization
Key Limitations: Limited to specific metrics, potential confounding variables

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: There is a negative correlation between intermediate-layer entropy and MMLU performance in Llama3
Location: Section 4.2
Exact Quote: the correlation between intermediate-layer entropy and MMLU performance in Llama3 is strongly negative (-0.43 between the second and later layers)

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Performance comparison between Llama3-8B and Mamba2-8B
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Correlation does not imply causation, limited to two models
  Exact Quote: Llama3 achieves 63.85±0.38% accuracy, far surpassing Mamba2's 26.76±0.37%

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Clear correlation demonstrated with specific numbers
Key Limitations: Limited model comparison, correlation may not indicate causation

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 4:
Type: result
Statement: Most significant changes in representation quality occur in intermediate layers during training
Location: Section 4.3.2
Exact Quote: The results show that the most significant changes occur in the intermediate layers. As training progresses, prompt entropy in these layers decreases, indicating that the model is learning to compress and abstract input information more efficiently.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Analysis of metrics across training checkpoints
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.3.2
  Limitations: May not capture all aspects of training dynamics
  Exact Quote: The metrics for the earliest layers remain relatively stable throughout training

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Consistent pattern observed across training progression
Key Limitations: Limited metrics used, specific training conditions
