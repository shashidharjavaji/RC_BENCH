Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: The proposed multimodal framework outperformed the unimodal framework for unsupervised opinion summarization
Location: Section 7.2 Ablation Studies
Exact Quote: we conclude that the multimodal framework outperformed the unimodal framework for unsupervised opinion summarization

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Performance improvements shown in ablation study comparing unimodal vs multimodal variants
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 4
  Limitations: Limited to two datasets (Yelp and Amazon)
  Exact Quote: MultimodalSum w/o image modality w/o table modality - 19.84 19.54 19.47

- Evidence Text: ROUGE and BERT-score improvements over baseline models
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 2
  Limitations: Automatic metrics may not fully capture summary quality
  Exact Quote: MultimodalSum (ours) 33.00 6.63 19.84* 87.7* 34.19* 7.05* 20.81 87.9

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Multiple evaluation metrics and ablation studies consistently show improvements from multimodal approach
Key Limitations: Limited dataset scope, reliance on automatic metrics

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: The proposed multimodal training pipeline effectively resolves heterogeneity between input modalities
Location: Section 5 Model Training Pipeline
Exact Quote: To effectively train the model framework, we set a model training pipeline, which consists of three steps

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Performance degradation when removing pretraining steps
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Table 4
  Limitations: Indirect evidence of resolving heterogeneity
  Exact Quote: w/o other modalities pretraining w/o text modality pretraining w/o all modalities pretraining - 19.26 19.24 19.14

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Ablation studies show value of training pipeline but direct evidence of resolving heterogeneity is limited
Key Limitations: Lack of direct measurement of modality alignment

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: performance
Statement: The model achieves better human evaluation scores than baseline methods
Location: Section 7.1.2 Human Evaluation
Exact Quote: MultimodalSum outperformed gold summaries for two criteria

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Best-Worst Scaling human evaluation results
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 6
  Limitations: Limited to 30 samples and 10 evaluators
  Exact Quote: MultimodalSum: 0.367 0.290 0.260

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Clear performance advantage in human evaluation but limited sample size
Key Limitations: Small evaluation scale, potential evaluator bias

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 4:
Type: performance
Statement: The proposed pivot-based pretraining approach for non-text modalities outperforms alternative approaches
Location: Section A.4
Exact Quote: our method based on the text decoder outperformed the Triplet based on the text encoder

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Reference review generation results comparison
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 7
  Limitations: Limited to one alternative approach (Triplet)
  Exact Quote: Image: 25.87 3.62 15.70, Table: 27.32 4.12 16.57

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Clear performance advantage over baseline but limited comparison scope
Key Limitations: Only compared against one alternative approach
