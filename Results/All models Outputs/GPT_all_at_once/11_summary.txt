Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: AutoAIS correlates well with human judgment at the system level, offering promise as a development metric where human rating is infeasible.
Location: Conclusion section
Exact Quote: AutoAIS correlates well with human judgment at the system level, offering promise as a development metric where human rating is infeasible.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Correlation between system AIS and AutoAIS scores is remarkably strong, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.96.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.5 Correlation between AIS and EM/AutoAIS
  Limitations: Lower and more variable correlation at the instance level.
  Exact Quote: correlation between system AIS and AutoAIS scores is remarkably strong, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.96.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The strong Pearson correlation coefficient at the system level justifies the conclusion about AutoAIS's promise as a development metric.
Key Limitations: The lower correlation at the instance level indicates variability and potential limitations for detailed, instance-specific evaluation.

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: Retrieve-then-read approaches achieve the strongest performance on Attributed QA evaluation.
Location: Conclusion section
Exact Quote: Retrieve-then-read approaches achieve the strongest performance on our evaluation.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Best RTR achieves highest AIS performance compared to other systems, even with smaller LLMs, but requires significant explicit supervision.
  Strength: strong
  Location: System Results section
  Limitations: High dependence on the accuracy of the retrieval step and need for significant explicit supervision.
  Exact Quote: Best RTR achieves the highest performance...despite using LLMs with relatively small numbers of parameters.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Empirical results support the claim of RTR approaches performing strongly; however, their effectiveness hinges on substantial supervision and accurate retrieval.
Key Limitations: Considerable need for explicit supervision can limit the scalability and adaptability to less structured or different domains of data.
