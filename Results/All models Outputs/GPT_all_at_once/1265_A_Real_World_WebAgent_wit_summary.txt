Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: WebAgent plans ahead by decomposing instructions into sub-instructions, summarizes HTML documents, and acts on websites via Python programs generated from those.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: WebAgent plans ahead by decomposing instructions into sub-instructions, summarizes long HTML documents into task-relevant snippets, and acts on websites via Python programs generated from those.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: WebAgent combines HTML-T5 for planning and summarization with Flan-U-PaLM for code generation.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: Lack of specific empirical examples detailing how the process works step-by-step.
  Exact Quote: We design WebAgent with Flan-U-PaLM, for grounded code generation, and HTML-T5, a new pre-trained LLM for long HTML documents using local and global attention mechanisms and a mixture of long-span denoising objectives, for planning and summarization.

- Evidence Text: Self-experience supervision where domain-expert language models are finetuned with self-generated data enhances planning, summarization, and program synthesis for real-world tasks.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Self-Experience Supervision for Alignment with Real Websites
  Limitations: Does not provide details on the volume or variety of data used for finetuning.
  Exact Quote: Our WebAgent aligns domain-specific language models, such as HTML-T5, with these self-gathered real-world experiences through fine-tuning.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is backed by the description of technology stack, showing integration of specialized models for components of the web automation task sequence. However, the evidence would benefit from detailed case studies or more comprehensive data on the variety of tasks and environments WebAgent has been tested in.
Key Limitations: Lack of transparency about the data variety and volume used for fine-tuning as well as the absence of detailed step-by-step examples.

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: WebAgent significantly increases success rate by over 50% on real websites context compared to a single LLM approach.
Location: Conclusion
Exact Quote: Our proposed WebAgent achieves around 70-80% success on real websites via self-experience supervision, outperforming single LLM approach by over 50%.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Real-world evaluation showing success rates of 65%, 70%, and 80% on different types of websites.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Experimental Results
  Limitations: Focuses on aggregate success rates without dissecting performance based on task complexity or type.
  Exact Quote: The score stands for the percentage of covered attributes specified in given instructions. WebAgent, with language model modules for planning and summarization, achieves the best success (65%, 70%, 80%, respectively).

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is validated by direct experimental outcomes demonstrating superior performance in practical use cases across a range of website types. The evidence, illustrated by success rates in real-world tasks, directly supports the claim of enhanced performance.
Key Limitations: While the results are promising, they are limited in scope regarding task diversity, and lack granularity on performance across different task types or complexities.
