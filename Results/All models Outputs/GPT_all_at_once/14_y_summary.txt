Statement: M3ID's operation at inference time does not require additional training or access to model weights.
Location: Introduction/Methodology
Exact Quote: M3ID is applicable to any off-the-shelf model without additional training or access to model weights, offering a low computational overhead alternative to standard decoding algorithms.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: M3ID adjusts the generation process based on visual prompt dependency, effectively leveraging mutual information between text and image without model retraining.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction, Figure 1
  Limitations: Depends on the quality of existing model weights and their compatibility with M3ID.
  Exact Quote: M3ID amplifies the conditioned directions that are not already predicted by the unconditioned model more as new tokens are generated.

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: Pairing M3ID with DPO improves grounding of VLM outputs on visual prompts beyond M3ID alone.
Location: Results/Discussion
Exact Quote: M3ID can be paired with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve the modelâ€™s reliance on the prompt image without requiring any labels.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Combining M3ID with DPO shows further reduction in hallucinated objects and improvements in grounding, supported by quantitative results on captioning tasks and VQA benchmarks.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results, Section 5.2 and Table 1
  Limitations: Results specific to implemented benchmarks; broader applications and other tasks need to be explored.
