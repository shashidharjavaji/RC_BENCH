Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: The proposed method achieves the best performance under three metrics compared with seven static methods.
Location: Section 1/Paragraph 4
Exact Quote: Compared with seven static methods, our proposed method achieves the best performance on three metrics.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The method significantly reduces the probability of the correct knowledge token in GPT2 and Llama-7B.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1/Results and analysis
  Limitations: Limited to two models and specific knowledge types.
  Exact Quote: when only intervening ten FFN neurons, the probability of the correct knowledge token reduces from 7.1% to 3.4% in GPT2, and from 21.5% to 9.2% in Llama-7B.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Evidence demonstrates method's effectiveness in attributing neurons significantly impacting final predictions; however, it's based on limited models and types.
Key Limitations: Lack of diverse model evaluation and focused on specific types of knowledge.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: contribution
Statement: Both attention and FFN layers can store knowledge, with all important neurons directly contributing to knowledge prediction in deep layers.
Location: Section 3/Paragraph 1
Exact Quote: Both attention and FFN layers can store knowledge, and all important neurons directly contribute to knowledge prediction are in deep layers.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Value neurons are activated by attention value neurons from medium-deep layers, and these, in turn, by shallow-medium FFN query neurons.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3/Paragraph 4
  Limitations: The analysis focused on the impact of neuron depth on knowledge storage without considering the effects of neuron width or other factors.
  Exact Quote: FFN value neurons are mainly activated by medium-deep attention value neurons, while these attention neurons are mainly activated by shallow/medium FFN query neurons.

- Evidence Text: Shared value and query neurons display different distributions across models, implying varying storage and retrieval mechanisms.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.2/Table 8
  Limitations: Insight derived from top-ranking neurons in limited models, may not generalize.
  Exact Quote: On average, there are 27.6% shared value neurons in GPT2 and 14.1% in Llama.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Empirical data supports the claim of deep layer importance in knowledge storage but narrower examination scope.
Key Limitations: Study narrowly focuses on specific models and knowledge type attributions.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: performance
Statement: The log probability increase method outperforms other attribution metrics in identifying neurons that significantly influence final predictions.
Location: Section 3.4/Paragraph 2
Exact Quote: Compared with the other seven methods, our attribution method [...] attributes more important neurons, resulting in the most significant reduction across all metrics in both GPT2 and Llama.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The method leads to a significant decrease in the correct knowledge token's probability in intervention experiments.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.4/Table 2
  Limitations: Effectiveness demonstrated under controlled conditions; real-world applicability may vary.
  Exact Quote: when only intervening ten FFN neurons, the probability of the correct knowledge token reduces from 7.1% to 3.4% in GPT2, and from 21.5% to 9.2% in Llama-7B.

- Evidence Text: Attribution using log probability increase more effectively captures neurons in medium-deep to very deep layers compared to other methods.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.2/Paragraph 5
  Limitations: Primarily based on synthetic intervention analysis, lacks verification in naturally occurring model usage.
  Exact Quote: [...] employing probability increase is more inclined to attribute neurons in the deepest layers, whereas log probability increase tends to attribute neurons in medium-deep layers.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Direct correlation between the method usage and measurable outcomes; however, based on specific implementations and models.
Key Limitations: Efficiency and applicability may hinge on the specific qualities of the LLMs being analyzed.
