Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: MindMap significantly improves hallucination quantification compared to both Neighbor-only and Path-only methods.
Location: Section 4.6 In-depth Analysis/4.6.4 How does MindMap leverage LLM knowledge for various tasks?
Exact Quote: MindMap showed significant improvements in hallucination quantification compared to both Neighbor-only and Path-only methods.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: In experimental tokens, MindMap achieves a higher BERT Score and much lower hallucination quantify compared to 'Path-only' and 'Neighbor-only' methods.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.6 In-depth Analysis/4.6.4 How does MindMap leverage LLM knowledge for various tasks?
  Limitations: Does not provide detailed statistical significance or comparison against a broader set of baselines.
  Exact Quote: MindMap 0.7938 0.7987 0.7960 0.5890, Path-only 0.6310 0.7885 0.7002 0.3854, Neighbor-only 0.6393 0.7930 0.7072 0.3894

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Evidence directly supports the claim with quantitative measures showing improvement in both BERT Score and reduction in hallucination quantify.
Key Limitations: Lack of broad comparative analysis and details on statistical tests.

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: MindMap effectively leverages both external and implicit knowledge in graph reasoning, yielding more accurate answers.
Location: Section 4.3 Long Dialogue Question Answering
Exact Quote: MindMap leverages both external and implicit knowledge in graph reasoning, yielding more accurate answers.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: MindMap shows superior accuracy in comparison to various baselines in the ExplainCPE dataset, emphasizing effectiveness over document retrieval prompting techniques.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.4 Generate with Mismatch Knowledge from KG/4.4.2 Results
  Limitations: Comparative analysis mainly focused on accuracy without extensive discussion on reasoning capability across different question types.
  Exact Quote: our method (MindMap) demonstrates superior accuracy compared to various baselines

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Claim is supported by superior accuracy results, which demonstrates MindMap's effective use of external and implicit knowledge.
Key Limitations: Limited detailed analysis on how external and implicit knowledge contribute to reasoning across diverse dialogue contexts.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: performance
Statement: MindMap's performance is highly robust to mismatched retrieval knowledge.
Location: Section 4.6 In-depth Analysis/4.6.1 How does MindMap perform without correct KG knowledge?
Exact Quote: MindMap achieves an accuracy rate of 55% even when KG Retriever errs, showcasing its robustness.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Faced with misleading symptom facts, MindMap accurately identifies cirrhosis and recommends the relevant 'blood test', contrary to baseline models.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.6 In-depth Analysis/4.6.2 How robust is MindMap to unmatched fact queries?
  Limitations: Evidence is limited to a specific scenario. Broad applicability of the model's robustness to various types of mismatched knowledge remains unspecified.
  Exact Quote: our model MindMap accurately identifies cirrhosis’ and recommends the relevant ‘blood test’

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The ability of MindMap to generate correct recommendations in the face of misleading facts directly supports its robustness.
Key Limitations: Specific scenarios evaluated; a broader range of error types in KG knowledge would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robustness.
