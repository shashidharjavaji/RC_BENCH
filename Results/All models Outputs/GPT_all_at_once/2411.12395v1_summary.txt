Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: Fine-tuning a GPT-4o-mini model with few-shot methods on a small scale does not improve its performance on ambiguous questions.
Location: RQ2, Results and Discussion
Exact Quote: fine-tuning, at least at this small scale, does not provide any improvement in LLM performance on ambiguous questions.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The GT Answer Overlap for the fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini model on ambiguous questions was 0.626, compared to 0.643 for the non-fine-tuned model.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: RQ2, Results and Discussion
  Limitations: The fine-tuning experiment was limited to a small scale, with only 50 question-answer pairs, possibly affecting the outcomes.
  Exact Quote: The GT Answer Overlap for the 4o-mini model is 0.643 while that for the fine-tuned 4o-mini model is 0.626.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence directly supports the claim, though the small scale of the fine-tuning may limit the generalizability of the finding.
Key Limitations: Limited scale of fine-tuning and potential variability in the quality of question-answer pairs used.

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: Lowering the temperature value for LLM generation marginally improves performance on ambiguous questions but not significantly.
Location: RQ3, Results and Discussion
Exact Quote: although lower temperature seem to have minor improvements in some cases, the difference is not that significant.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Minor improvements were observed in some cases when lowering the temperature for LLM generation, implying a reduced variance but not a significant performance increase.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: RQ3, Results and Discussion
  Limitations: The analysis did not quantify the improvement, leaving the degree of performance change ambiguous.
  Exact Quote: minor improvements in some cases, the difference is not that significant.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The results suggest a trend towards improvement with lower temperature settings, though the lack of quantification limits the impact assessment.
Key Limitations: Absence of quantifiable data to back the observation of improvement.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: performance
Statement: Contextual enrichment significantly enhances disambiguation accuracy for a subset of AmbigQA, where human-provided answers match the ground truth.
Location: Conclusion and Future Works
Exact Quote: adding context to those questions increases the accuracy of the model.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Contextual enrichment skewed performance towards more accurate responses in cases where the human-provided disambiguated question matched the ground truth answer closely.
  Strength: strong
  Location: VI. Conclusion and Future Works
  Limitations: The improvement was specific to cases where human-provided disambiguation matched the ground truth, which may not generalize to all types of ambiguity.
  Exact Quote: adding context to those questions increases the accuracy of the model.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Direct evidence from experimental results supports the claim, indicating contextual enrichment as effective in specific cases.
Key Limitations: Generalization of results to other types of ambiguities and questions not covered in the specific subset examined.
