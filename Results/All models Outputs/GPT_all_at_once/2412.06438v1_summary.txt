Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: Foundation models show significant exploratory capabilities and effective navigation of complex abstract problem spaces.
Location: Introduction/Section 1
Exact Quote: Our experiments with Gemini 1.5 reveal significant exploratory capabilities, effective navigation of complex abstract problem spaces, the discovery of novel solutions, and the achievement of predefined objectives with minimal guidance.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Gemini's exploration efficiency significantly outperforms random baselines and remains near optimal across different environments.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results/Section 4
  Limitations: Performance degrades with increased task complexity and is partly hindered by limitations in policy translation and in-context memory use.
  Exact Quote: While performance tends to decrease as environmental complexity increases, exploration efficiency significantly outperforms random baselines.

- Evidence Text: In specific tasks, smaller models performed better for single-feature-based rewards, and self-correction improved performance on conjunction-based rewards.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Discussion/Conclusion
  Limitations: The model's translation of task description to policy and effectiveness in using in-context memory are identified as performance limiting factors.
  Exact Quote: For single-feature-based rewards, we find that smaller models curiously perform better; for conjunction-based rewards, incorporating self-correction into the model improves performance.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: While the claim is supported by evidence from experiments showing outperformance over baselines and near-optimal efficiency, the impact of task complexity on performance and the specific contributions of model features to exploration capabilities suggest the need for further refinement.
Key Limitations: Increased complexity in the task leads to performance degradation, and the inability to effectively translate the task description to a policy as well as limitations in in-context memory usage represent critical areas for improvement.

Claim 2:
Type: contribution
Statement: The proposed framework effectively evaluates foundation models' directed exploration capabilities in both text-based and 3D embodied environments.
Location: Introduction/Section 1
Exact Quote: We propose a novel framework for evaluating the directed exploration capabilities of LLMs and VLMs in interactive environments, outlining methodologies for assessment in the zero-shot setting, without the need for fine-tuning or other post-training modifications.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The implementation of the framework in distinct text-based and 3D embodied simulations with comprehensive assessments of various complexity levels, model sizes, and strategic approaches (self-correction, in-context exploration).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Experimental Setup/Section 4
  Limitations: Applicability primarily demonstrated within controlled experimental setups, potentially limiting generalizability to real-world scenarios.
  Exact Quote: Our experiments aim to address key questions on how environment complexity and model size impact exploration capabilities, and whether different approaches improve exploration efficiency.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The framework's design and its application across diverse environments and tasks strongly support the claim of its effectiveness in evaluating foundation models' exploration capabilities. The evidence through detailed experimental results reinforces the claim, notwithstanding considerations for broader applicability and real-world challenges.
Key Limitations: While the framework proves effective within experimental settings, extending its utility and validating its effectiveness in more dynamic, less controlled environments could enhance its contribution.
