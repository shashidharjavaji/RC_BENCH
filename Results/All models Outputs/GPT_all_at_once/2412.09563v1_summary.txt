  Exact Quote: Model Number of Tasks where Best Performance is not in Last Layer Avg. Last Layer Performance Avg. Best Layer Performance LLM2Vec 8B (Transformer) 100% 64.7% 66.8% Pythia 410M (Transformer) 96.6% 49.8% 53.3% Mamba 130M (SSM) 100% 46.9% 50.9%

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Empirical evidence demonstrates better performance from intermediate layers across various models and tasks.
Key Limitations: Generalizability of findings and dependence on the specific metrics and tasks chosen for evaluation.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Distinct encoding behaviors and representation stability differ between Transformers and SSMs, with Transformers exhibiting greater variability.
Location: Experimental Setup for Evaluating Representation Quality
Exact Quote: Transformers exhibited greater representational variability and information compression within intermediate layers, whereas SSMs displayed more stable and consistent representations.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Analysis of entropy, InfoNCE, LiDAR, and DiME metrics showcasing distinct behaviors between the two architectures across layers.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Experimental Setup for Evaluating Representation Quality/Figure 1
  Limitations: Dependent on metrics used, may not capture all aspects of representational quality.
  Exact Quote: For entropy and LiDAR, Pythia shows a pronounced decrease at intermediate layers, suggesting greater information compression and consolidation. In contrast, Mamba maintains more stable values, indicating less compression in its intermediate representations.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The observed differences in metrics between architectures suggest distinct representational strategies, supported by quantitative measurements.
Key Limitations: Findings are metrics-dependent and focused on specific layers without considering the entirety of the models' behaviors.

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: Intermediate layers play a pivotal role in adapting to diverse input conditions, showing distinct responses due to input perturbations.
Location: Effects of Extreme Input Conditions
Exact Quote: Our investigation into extreme input conditions revealed that intermediate layers play a pivotal role in adapting to diverse input scenarios, with distinct responses to token repetition, randomness, and prompt length.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Analysis of prompt entropy across various extreme input conditions demonstrating adaptation in intermediate layers.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Prompt Entropy under Extreme Input Conditions/Figure 3
  Limitations: Investigation focused on the Pythia 410M model, may not generalize across all LLM architectures.
  Exact Quote: Increasing token repetition reduces entropy in intermediate layers. Increasing token randomness elevates entropy, particularly in initial layers. Prompt length influences entropy in Both normalized and unnormalized Forms.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Evidence from specific experimental setups shows how intermediate layers adapt to input variations, though findings are based on one model's analysis.
Key Limitations: Generalizability of results to other LLMs and the specificity of input conditions tested.
