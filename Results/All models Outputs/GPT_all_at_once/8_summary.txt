Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: REPLUG significantly improves the performance of various black-box LMs on both language modeling and downstream tasks, including MMLU and open-domain QA.
Location: Introduction, Experiments
Exact Quote: Our experiments demonstrate that REPLUG with the tuned retriever significantly improves the performance of GPT-3 (175B) on language modeling by 6.3%, as well as the performance of Codex on five-shot MMLU by 5.1%.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: REPLUG and REPLUG LSR improve the original Codex model by 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively, on the MMLU dataset.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results, MMLU dataset evaluation
  Limitations: Comparison to Flan-PaLM's performance indicates room for improvement.
  Exact Quote: Both the REPLUG and REPLUG LSR improve the original Codex model by 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively.

- Evidence Text: REPLUG LSR significantly improves the performance of the original Codex by 12.0% on NQ and 5.0% on TQA.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results, Open-domain QA evaluation
  Limitations: Result still lags behind retrieval-augmented models fine-tuned on the full training data.
  Exact Quote: REPLUG LSR significantly improves the performance of the original Codex by 12.0% on NQ and 5.0% on TQA.

- Evidence Text: REPLUG is applicable to diverse language models with varying sizes, consistently improving perplexity across models.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Analysis, Applicability to diverse models
  Limitations: The specific impact on individual model sizes and types is not uniformly distributed.
  Exact Quote: REPLUG improves the perplexity of all the model families, which indicates that REPLUG is applicable to diverse language models with different sizes.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Supporting evidence from multiple experiments across different model sizes and tasks show consistent performance improvements.
Key Limitations: Comparative analysis with models like Flan-PaLM and the lack of uniform improvement across all model sizes.
