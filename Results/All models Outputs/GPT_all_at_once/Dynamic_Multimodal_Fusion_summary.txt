Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: Dynamic multimodal fusion (DynMM) offers computational savings and enhanced performance for 'easy' inputs, while matching the representation power of static networks for 'hard' inputs.
Location: Introduction section
Exact Quote: dynamic fusion leads to computational savings for 'easy' inputs that can be correctly predicted using only a subset of modalities or simple fusion operations. For 'hard' multimodal inputs, DynMM can match the representation power of a static network by relying on all modalities and complex fusion operations for prediction.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: For the MM-IMDB movie genre classification task, DynMM-a substantially reduced computations by 46.5% with only a minor decrease in accuracy.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Experiments on MM-IMDB dataset
  Limitations: Minor decrease in accuracy for some configurations
  Exact Quote: DynMM-a can reduce computations by 46.5% with a slightly decreased accuracy (i.e., -0.47%).

- Evidence Text: In RGB-D semantic segmentation tasks, DynMM achieves over 21% reductions in MAdds for the depth encoder with a mIoU improvement.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Experiments on RGB-D semantic segmentation
  Limitations: The reduction is specific to the depth encoder part of the system
  Exact Quote: DynMM achieves a +0.7% mIoU improvement with over 21% reductions in multiply-add operations (MAdds) for the depth encoder.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Substantial computational savings with minimal to no impact on accuracy across different tasks demonstrate the methodology's efficacy.
Key Limitations: Minor accuracy reductions in some scenarios; benefits primarily demonstrated on specific components like depth encoders.
