The method's effectiveness is supported by empirical results showing consistent accuracy improvements across different configurations and the ability to outperform traditional retrieval methods, such as BM25, on multiple QA datasets.",

The use of gold negatives and additional hard negatives (BM25 high score but not containing the answer) further supports the model's performance. These methods collectively lead to a strong and efficient training scheme.",

Methodological limitations, such as potential biases in negative sampling and the efficiency of index-building for dense vectors, were identified but not fully explored.",

The comparison with alternative training configurations, such as adding two BM25 negatives or using different types of negative examples, underscores the specific efficacy of this approach.",

The data clearly show that the addition of a single 'hard' BM25 negative improves the top-k retrieval accuracy, suggesting an effective method to increase the DPR model's understanding and handling of relevant versus irrelevant passages. Furthermore, the methodology of utilizing in-batch negatives provides an efficient and scalable approach to enhancing model training.",

Additionally, the analysis primarily compares the addition of 'hard' BM25 negatives against a relatively narrow set of alternative configurations without extensively exploring other potential negative sampling strategies.",
