This conclusion is drawn from the application of their framework to the GPT-4-generated explanations of GPT-2 XL neurons, which showed poor alignment between the explanations' predicted neuron activations and the actual neuron activations observed. Furthermore, the intervention-based evaluation revealed a lack of causal effects of neurons on the model behavior concerning the explained concepts.",

                "justification_explanation": "The conclusion is justified by the systematic application of both observational and intervention modes of evaluation, revealing significant shortcomings in the natural language explanations' ability to accurately predict neuron activations and to influence model behavior in a causally meaningful way. The evidence from detailed audits, such as the analysis of top-scoring neurons and intervention-based evaluation tasks, supports the authors' critical stance on the current capability of automatically generated natural language explanations to provide faithful and causally relevant insights into neuron function.",

The study thoroughly evaluates the precision, recall, and F1 scores of explanations in observational mode, alongside intervention-based assessments, to establish the explanations' lack of fidelity and causal efficacy. However, the evidence is somewhat limited by the reliance on GPT-4-generated explanations for GPT-2 XL neurons, suggesting that further studies across different models and explanation methods are needed to generalize these findings.",
                "limitations": "Specific limitations highlighted include the inherent challenges in natural language as a medium for model explanations due to its ambiguity and context-dependence, and the questionable appropriateness of focusing on neurons as the primary unit of analysis for understanding model behavior. Additionally, the study's scope is limited to observations from GPT-4 explanations of GPT-2 XL neurons, which may not capture the entirety of the landscape of explanation fidelity and causal efficacy across different models and explanation methodologies.",

This misalignment casts doubt on the utility of these explanations for reliable interpretability. Furthermore, the lack of observable causal effects in the intervention mode demonstrates that these neurons do not serve as effective causal mediators for the explained concepts, further undermining the conclusions drawn from GPT-4-generated explanations.",
                "robustness_analysis": "The methodology applied, involving both observational and intervention modes, systematically evaluates the claims of explanation faithfulness and causal efficacy; however, the findings reveal a weak correlation between GPT-4 confidence scores and actual neuron behavior. This indicates a methodological strength in revealing the limitations of the generated explanations but also highlights a significant gap in the interpretability offered by GPT-4 for GPT-2 XL neurons.",
