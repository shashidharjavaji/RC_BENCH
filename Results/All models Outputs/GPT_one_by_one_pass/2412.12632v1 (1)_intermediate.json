These limitations highlight areas for future research, particularly in enhancing CoE's accuracy and understanding the nuanced impacts of its features on LLM performance.",

                "evidence_alignment": "The evidence strongly aligns with the conclusion. Through empirical results (increased accuracy and efficiency) demonstrating ScopeCoE\u2019s effectiveness in RAG+ScopeCoE vs. RAG configurations, the claim is substantiated by clear performance improvements and efficiency gains.",
