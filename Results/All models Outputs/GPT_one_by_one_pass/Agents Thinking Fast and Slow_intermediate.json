This is analogous to behavioral science dual-System approach, with System 1 always being on while System 2 operates at a fraction of its capacity. Similarly, the Talker is always on and interacting with the environment, while the Reasoner updates beliefs informing the Talker only when the Talker waits for it, or can read it from memory. This division of labor works well most of the time, as the Talker is typically very good at what it does: it can automatically fetch information from memory, effectively priming its underlying model to respond well to familiar situations. However, the framework has limitations. The Talker operates with a more outdated view of the world, which has inherent biases, and can sometimes answer easier questions than the ones asked. Also, it has little understanding of complex problem solving and planning.

The framework's success in a real-world application (the sleep coaching agent) showcases its ability to process and respond to natural language dialogues effectively and to engage in problem-solving tasks by integrating external tools and knowledge bases. This demonstrates the substantive capacity of AI agents, driven by large language models, to understand complex patterns and perform multi-step reasoning.",

The differentiated capabilities of the Talker and Reasoner agents -- with the former handling immediate conversational needs and the latter engaging in deeper reasoning and planning -- exemplify a strong alignment with the cognitive theory of fast and slow thinking. This dual-system approach effectively reduces latency in agent responses and increases the relevance and accuracy of those responses by enabling the Talker to operate with real-time information while the Reasoner updates beliefs and plans in the background.",

Additionally, the reliance on external databases and tools for information retrieval and action execution introduces dependencies that could impact the agent's operational efficiency and response accuracy. Future research directions such as extending to multiple Reasoners for various reasoning types and optimizing the interaction between the Talker and Reasoner suggest areas for addressing these limitations.",
