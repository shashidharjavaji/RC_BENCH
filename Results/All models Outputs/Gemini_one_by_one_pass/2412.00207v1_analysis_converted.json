Notably, under the same personality setting, the standard deviation of the human perception scores is smaller than that of the chatbot self-reported score, indicating that human perceived scores show less variation between individuals, while chatbot self-reports exhibit greater variability.\nWhat is more interesting is the correlation between human perception scores and chatbot self-reported scores. Apart from the relatively high correlation (0.58 \u00b1 0.02) in the domain of agreeableness, the correlations in the others are all below 0.5.
