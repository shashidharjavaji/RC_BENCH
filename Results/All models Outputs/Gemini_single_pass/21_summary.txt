Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: The proposed attribution method can identify knowledge neurons that express factual knowledge in pretrained Transformers.
Location: section 4
Exact Quote: We propose an attribution method to identify knowledge neurons that express factual knowledge in pretrained Transformers.

Evidence:
Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: No
Robustness: low
Confidence Level: low
Justification: The claim is based on the proposed method, but there is no evidence provided to support its effectiveness.
Key Limitations: Lack of experimental validation

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Suppressing or amplifying the activation of knowledge neurons can accordingly affect the strength of knowledge expression.
Location: section 4
Exact Quote: We find that suppressing or amplifying the activation of knowledge neurons can accordingly affect the strength of knowledge expression.

Evidence:
Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: No
Robustness: low
Confidence Level: low
Justification: The claim is based on the observation, but there is no evidence provided to support the causal relationship between knowledge neuron activation and knowledge expression.
Key Limitations: Lack of experimental validation

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: Knowledge neurons tend to be activated by corresponding knowledge-expressing prompts.
Location: section 4
Exact Quote: Moreover, quantitative and qualitative analysis on open-domain texts shows that knowledge neurons tend to be activated by the corresponding knowledge-expressing prompts.

Evidence:
Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: No
Robustness: low
Confidence Level: low
Justification: The claim is based on the analysis of open-domain texts, but there is no evidence provided to show the generalization of the finding to other types of texts or tasks.
Key Limitations: Limited scope of analysis

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 4:
Type: contribution
Statement: The proposed method can be used to update or erase knowledge in pretrained Transformers.
Location: section 5
Exact Quote: In addition, we present two preliminary case studies that attempt to utilize knowledge neurons to update or erase knowledge in pretrained Transformers.

Evidence:
Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: No
Robustness: low
Confidence Level: low
Justification: The claim is based on preliminary case studies, but there is no evidence provided to show the effectiveness or generalizability of the approach.
Key Limitations: Limited scope of evaluation
