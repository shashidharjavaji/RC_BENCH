Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: The problem of ambiguity in open-domain question answering (QA) poses significant challenges to Large Language Models (LLMs) used for open-domain question answering.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: _Abstract—Ambiguity in natural language poses significant_**\n**challenges to Large Language Models (LLMs) used for open-**\n**domain question answering. LLMs often struggle with the**\n**inherent uncertainties of human communication, leading to**\n**misinterpretations, miscommunications, hallucinations, and bi-**\n**ased responses. This significantly weakens their ability to be**\n**used for tasks like fact-checking, question answering, feature**\n**extraction, and sentiment analysis.**

Evidence:
Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported by the fact that LLMs often struggle with the inherent uncertainties of human communication, leading to misinterpretations, miscommunications, hallucinations, and biased responses.
Key Limitations: The claim is limited to open-domain question answering.

Claim 2:
Type: contribution
Statement: Simple, training-free, token-level disambiguation methods may be effectively used to improve LLM performance for ambiguous question answering tasks.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: Using open-domain question**\n**answering as a test case, we compare off-the-shelf and few-shot**\n**LLM performance, focusing on measuring the impact of explicit**\n**disambiguation strategies. We demonstrate how simple, training-**\n**free, token-level disambiguation methods may be effectively used**\n**to improve LLM performance for ambiguous question answering**\n**tasks. We empirically show our findings and discuss best practices**\n**and broader impacts regarding ambiguity in LLMs.**

Evidence:

Type: contribution
Statement: The paper presents a dataset of 1,000 ambiguous questions and answers.
Location: Methodology and Experimental Settings
Exact Quote: We conduct a series of controlled experiments involving**\n**the two LLMs on a dataset of ambiguous real-world questions.**\n**Our approach emphasizes the evaluation of LLM sensitivity**\n**by measuring the effect of linguistic and contextual modifications on its output accuracy to answer ambiguous questions.**\n**We employed three distinct prompting strategies to generate**\n**answers from the selected LLMs: (1) a naive (or baseline)**\n**direct question-answering prompt, (2) a rephrasing strategy**\n**that attempts to add linguistic perturbation to the ambiguous**\n**question, and (3) a contextual enrichment approach that uses**\n**the model’s internal knowledge to disambiguate the given**

Evidence:
Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes

Claim 4:
Type: contribution
Statement: The paper presents three prompting strategies to generate answers from LLMs.
Location: Methodology and Experimental Settings
Exact Quote: We employed three distinct prompting strategies to generate**\n**answers from the selected LLMs: (1) a naive (or baseline)**\n**direct question-answering prompt, (2) a rephrasing strategy**\n**that attempts to add linguistic perturbation to the ambiguous**\n**question, and (3) a contextual enrichment approach that uses**\n**the model’s internal knowledge to disambiguate the given**

Evidence:

Claim 5:
Type: result
Statement: Contextual enrichment can significantly enhance model disambiguation accuracy.
Location: VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
Exact Quote: Our results indicate that contextual enrichment has the\nability to significantly enhance model disambiguation accuracy, but it is often inaccurate because it tends to add irrelevant\ncontext to questions, making them impossible to fix by prompting.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experiments showed that adding context to a subset of AmbigQA questions increased the accuracy of the model.
  Strength: strong
  Location: VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
  Limitations: Results are based on a subset of AmbigQA questions and may not generalize to all types of questions.
  Exact Quote: However, when we took a subset of AmbigQA where the\nhuman-provided answer of a human-provided disambiguated\nquestion provided matches the ground truth, adding context to\nthose questions increases the accuracy of the model.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is supported by experimental results, but the results are limited to a specific dataset and context enrichment method.
Key Limitations: The study did not evaluate the impact of contextual enrichment on different types of ambiguity or the scalability of the approach to larger datasets.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 6:
Type: result
Statement: LLMs struggle with ambiguity in prompts.
Location: VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
Exact Quote: Therefore, our analysis shows that even though LLMs struggle\nwith ambiguity in prompts, simple training-free prompt-based\ndisambiguation methods may help significantly in improving\nthe performance of the LLM.
