Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: The study uses a large English dataset to improve the AUC on the French dataset from 0.85 to 0.89.
Location: Conclusion and Future Work
Exact Quote: By incorporating a large English dataset, we were able to improve the AUC on the French dataset from 0.85 to 0.89.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The AUC on the French dataset increased from 0.85 to 0.89 after incorporating the large English dataset.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Conclusion and Future Work
  Limitations: The study does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific features or methods that contributed to the improvement.
  Exact Quote: By incorporating a large English dataset, we were able to improve the AUC on the French dataset from 0.85 to 0.89.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The study provides clear evidence of the improvement in AUC after incorporating the English dataset, but it does not explore the underlying reasons for this improvement.
Key Limitations: The study does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific features or methods that contributed to the improvement.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: The study develops a new set of features for dementia detection using concept-based language modelling, which improves AUC from 0.80 to 0.85 in the unilingual case and 0.88 to 0.89 in the multilingual case.
Location: Conclusion and Future Work
Exact Quote: We also developed a new set of features for this task, using concept-based language modelling, which improved AUC from 0.80 to 0.85 in the unilingual case, and 0.88 to 0.89 in the multilingual case.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The AUC in the unilingual case improved from 0.80 to 0.85 after using the new set of features.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Conclusion and Future Work
  Limitations: The study does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific features that contributed to the improvement.
  Exact Quote: We also developed a new set of features for this task, using concept-based language modelling, which improved AUC from 0.80 to 0.85 in the unilingual case, and 0.88 to 0.89 in the multilingual case.

- Evidence Text: The AUC in the multilingual case improved from 0.88 to 0.89 after using the new set of features.
  Strength: strong
