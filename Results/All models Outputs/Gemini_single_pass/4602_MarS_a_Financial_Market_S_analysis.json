For example, a sudden drop in trajectory variance could indicate an impending significant event, providing early warnings and\\nenhancing risk management.  3. Analysis Platform: MarS answers a wide range of \u201cwhat if\u201d questions by providing a realistic simulation environment. For instance, it evaluates the market impact of large orders\\nby comparing existing market impact formulas to simulated results, identifying potential\\nimprovements and gaining deeper insights into market dynamics.  4.
