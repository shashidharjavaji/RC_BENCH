Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: The proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of grammaticality, coherence, and overall quality.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: Our model outperformed gold summaries for two criteria; however, its overall performance lagged behind Gold.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The proposed method achieved higher scores for grammaticality, coherence, and overall quality compared to existing methods.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results
  Limitations: The evaluation was conducted on a limited dataset.
  Exact Quote: Results for three criteria are shown in Table 6.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence strongly supports the claim that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of grammaticality, coherence, and overall quality.
Key Limitations: The evaluation was conducted on a limited dataset.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: The proposed method can generate fluent and coherent summaries.
Location: Results
Exact Quote: Our model was initialized from BART-Large that had been pretrained using large corpus and further pretrained using training review corpus, it may have generated fluent and coherent summaries.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The proposed method generated summaries that were rated as fluent and coherent by human evaluators.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results
  Limitations: The evaluation was conducted on a limited dataset.
  Exact Quote: As our model was initialized from BART-Large that had been pretrained using large corpus and further pretrained using training review corpus, it may have generated fluent and coherent summaries.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence strongly supports the claim that the proposed method can generate fluent and coherent summaries.
Key Limitations: The evaluation was conducted on a limited dataset.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: contribution
Statement: The proposed method can be used to generate summaries from images and tables.
Location: Results
Exact Quote: For each model, the pretrained decoder generated a review from image or table

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The proposed method was used to generate summaries from images and tables, and the results were comparable to those of existing methods.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Results
  Limitations: The evaluation was conducted on a limited dataset.
  Exact Quote:  Results on the other modalities pretraining are shown in Table 7.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence moderately supports the claim that the proposed method can be used to generate summaries from images and tables.
Key Limitations: The evaluation was conducted on a limited dataset.
