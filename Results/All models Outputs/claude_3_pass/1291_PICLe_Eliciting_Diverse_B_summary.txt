Claim 6:
Statement: PICLe[+] improves PICLe by 5.0% points and outperforms the similarity baseline, achieving the best performance overall (93.1%)
Location: Results section
Type: Performance result
Quote: The table shows that PICLe[+] improves PICLe by 5.0% points, and outperforms the similarity baseline, achieving the best performance overall (93.1%).

Evidence:
- Results showing PICLe[+] performance improvements
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3 Results
  Limitations: Only tested on Llama-2
  Quote: We also demonstrate PICLe[+], a variant that only uses the positive-labeled statements for Persona SFT and ICL example selection. The table shows that PICLe[+] improves PICLe by 5.0% points, and outperforms the similarity baseline, achieving the best performance overall (93.1%)

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Only shows improvement on one model/metric
Confidence: high

Claim 7:
Statement: PICLe preserves the original model distribution by avoiding unnecessary distributional changes with respect to familiar persona types
Location: Analyses section
Type: Method property
Quote: This suggests that our method preserves the original model distribution by avoiding unnecessary distributional changes with respect to familiar persona types.

Evidence:
- Analysis of distribution changes for different persona types
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.2
  Limitations: Limited sample of personas analyzed
  Quote: PICLe mostly renders the smallest values for the 'favorable' personas. That is, our method shifts the distribution minimally for personas that might already be elicited by the Helpfulness and Harmlessness objective

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Qualitative analysis, may not generalize to all persona types
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 8:
Statement: PICLe retains high performance of 87.0 consistency even with only 40% of the samples
Location: Computational Efficiency Analysis
Type: Performance result
Quote: Surprisingly, PICLe retains a high performance of 87.0 consistency even with only 40% of the samples.

Evidence:
- Data efficiency results
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.4
  Limitations: Only tested on Llama-2
  Quote: PICLe retains a high performance of 87.0 consistency even with only 40% of the samples

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Single data point, may not generalize across different sampling strategies
Confidence: medium
