Claim 3:
Statement: ByteScience outperformed traditional methods across all tasks (NER, RE, ER) with fewer samples
Location: Section IV - Structured Data Extraction Performance
Type: Comparative performance claim
Quote: our system outperformed traditional methods across all tasks with fewer samples

Evidence:
- Performance comparison table shows ByteScience outperforming other models in NER, RE, and ER tasks
  Strength: strong
