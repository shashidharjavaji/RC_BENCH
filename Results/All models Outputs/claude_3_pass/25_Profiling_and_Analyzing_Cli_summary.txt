=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: The authors extracted and profiled 10,393 statements from IPCC AR6 reports with associated uncertainty levels and glossary terms
Location: Abstract
Type: Method/Dataset
Quote: We represent the 10,393 statements from the latest IPCC reports (AR6) with associated uncertainty levels and glossary terms.

Evidence:
- Total number of statements extracted is explicitly stated
  Strength: strong
  Location: Overall statement profile section
  Limitations: None
  Quote: We obtained 10,393 statements, which is in excess of the 8,094 statements extracted by Lacombe, Wu, and Dilworth (2023)

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: No validation of extraction accuracy provided
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: HTML parsing is more reliable than PDF extraction for IPCC reports despite recent developments in PDF extraction tools
Location: Extracting Statement Text
Type: Method Finding
Quote: While the PDF versions of the reports are available, we find HTML parsing more reliable despite recent developments in PDF extraction tools

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: No evidence or comparison provided to support HTML vs PDF reliability claim
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: Over 90% of statements in the dataset have confidence levels above medium
Location: Overall statement profile
Type: Result Finding
Quote: Over 90% of the overall statements have confidence levels above medium (i.e., medium, high, or very high)

Evidence:
- Confidence level distribution is explicitly stated
  Strength: strong
  Location: Overall statement profile section
  Limitations: None
  Quote: Over 90% of the overall statements have confidence levels above medium (i.e., medium, high, or very high)

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Only applies to statements with confidence levels, not full dataset
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: High confidence is the most common confidence level for statements in most chapters except chapter bodies of WGI and WGIII reports
Location: Overall statement profile
Type: Result Finding
Quote: high confidence is the most common confidence level for statements in most chapters, except for those in the chapter bodies of the WGI and WGIII reports

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Specific distribution numbers not provided, relies on interpretation of Figure 2
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: 91.3% of statements with confidence levels and 84.9% of statements with likelihood levels contain at least one key term
Location: Overall statement profile
Type: Result Finding
Quote: 91.3% of C and 84.9% of L contain at least one key term

Evidence:
- Exact percentages of statements with key terms
  Strength: strong
  Location: Overall statement profile section
  Limitations: None
  Quote: 91.3% of C and 84.9% of L contain at least one key term

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: No details on distribution of number of key terms per statement
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: GPT-generated statements lack uncertainty assessment information and supporting references compared to the authors' extracted statements
Location: Case Study 3
Type: Comparative Finding
Quote: As mentioned in Case Study 2, such references provide important scientific evidence supporting the statements. Additionally, the GPT-generated statements lack uncertainty assessment information as we do.

Evidence:
- Comparison with GPT outputs shows lack of uncertainty info
  Strength: strong
  Location: Case Study 3
  Limitations: Limited to one case study example
  Quote: Additionally, the GPT-generated statements lack uncertainty assessment information as we do. Confidence and likelihood levels are crucial for evaluating the validity and probability of the statements.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Based on limited comparison examples, may not be representative of all GPT outputs
Confidence: medium
