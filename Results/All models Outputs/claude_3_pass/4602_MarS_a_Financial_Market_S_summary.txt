Quote: Among the broad adoption of AI techniques in finance, MarS is the first to fully leverage the core elements of financial markets, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of downstream applications.

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: No clear evidence provided comparing to other systems or demonstrating uniqueness of approach
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: LMM shows strong scalability across data size and model complexity
Location: Abstract
Type: Results claim
Quote: Key observations include LMM's strong scalability across data size and model complexity, and MarS's robust and practicable realism in controlled generation with market impact.

Evidence:
- Scaling curves show improved performance with increased data and model sizes for both Order Model and Order-Batch Model
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.1.3
  Limitations: Maximum sizes tested were 32B tokens/1B parameters for Order Model and 10B tokens/3B parameters for Order-Batch Model
  Quote: Our findings indicate that as the size of the data and the model increases, LMM's performance improves significantly, consistent with the scaling laws observed in other foundation models.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Scaling curves only shown for two components, absolute performance metrics not provided
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: MarS achieves robust and practicable realism in controlled generation with market impact
Location: Abstract
Type: Results claim
Quote: Key observations include LMM's strong scalability across data size and model complexity, and MarS's robust and practicable realism in controlled generation with market impact.

Evidence:
- Market impact validation shows adherence to Square-Root-Law
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3.2
  Limitations: Only validated against one established market impact law
  Quote: We validated these simulations by collecting market impacts from agents with various configurations, confirming that the synthetic data adheres to the Square-Root-Law

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Only one market impact law validated, limited real-world comparison
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: LMM scales effectively with increasing data and model size
Location: Introduction
Type: Results claim
Quote: By leveraging structured market data, LMM scales effectively with increasing data and model size, as we will demonstrate through scaling law evaluation, revealing its potential for handling large-scale financial markets.

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: No specific evidence provided beyond what's covered in claim 2
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: MarS successfully replicates key stylized facts from historical market data
Location: Experiments section
Type: Results claim
Quote: MarS successfully replicates these stylized facts, demonstrating its capability to produce highly realistic market simulations suitable for practical applications.

Evidence:
- Experimental results showing MarS replicates three key stylized facts from historical data
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.1, Figure 5
  Limitations: Only three stylized facts shown in main paper, though claims eleven total in appendix
  Quote: MarS successfully replicates these stylized facts, demonstrating its capability to produce highly realistic market simulations suitable for practical applications.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Only three stylized facts shown, may not represent full market complexity
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: MarS is the first to build a financial world simulator using foundation models
Location: Related Works
Type: Novelty claim
Quote: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to build a financial world simulator.

Evidence:
- Direct statement of being first financial world simulator
  Strength: weak
  Location: Appendix A
  Limitations: Claim made in related work discussion without direct comparison evidence
  Quote: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to build a financial world simulator.

Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: No evidence comparing to other potential financial simulators using foundation models
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 7:
Statement: LMM is the first to reveal scaling laws on trading orders
Location: Related Works
Type: Novelty claim
Quote: We propose a Large Market Model (LMM), which, for the first time, reveals the scaling law on trading orders.

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: No evidence provided demonstrating novelty or comparing to prior work on trading order scaling
Confidence: low
