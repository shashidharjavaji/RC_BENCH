=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: DynMM can reduce computation costs by 46.5% with only negligible accuracy loss on CMU-MOSEI sentiment analysis task
Location: Abstract
Type: Result
Quote: DynMM can reduce the computation costs by 46.5% with only a negligible accuracy loss (CMU-MOSEI sentiment analysis)

Evidence:
- DynMM-a reduces MAdds by 46.5% with only -0.47% accuracy drop compared to Late Fusion baseline
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3 Sentiment Analysis
  Limitations: Only one test configuration presented
  Quote: Compared with the best performing static network (i.e., Late Fusion), DynMM-a can reduce computations by 46.5% with a slightly decreased accuracy (i.e., -0.47%).

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Tested only on one dataset/task, accuracy drop while small still exists
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: DynMM improves segmentation performance with over 21% savings in computation compared to static fusion approaches
Location: Abstract
Type: Result
Quote: improve segmentation performance with over 21% savings in computation (NYU Depth V2 semantic segmentation) when compared with static fusion approaches

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: Direct evidence not clearly presented in the paper for this specific claim
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: DynMM-b achieves 0.7% mIoU improvement and 21.1% reduction in MAdds compared to static fusion
Location: Results/Semantic Segmentation
Type: Result
Quote: DynMM-b achieves a mIoU improvement of 0.7% and 21.1% reduction in MAdds at the same time

Evidence:
- DynMM-b performance metrics on semantic segmentation task
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4 Semantic Segmentation
  Limitations: Limited to one dataset/configuration
  Quote: DynMM-b achieves a mIoU improvement of 0.7% and 21.1% reduction in MAdds at the same time

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Results specific to NYU Depth V2 dataset, limited testing scenarios
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: DynMM shows better robustness against noise compared to static ESANet
Location: Results/Semantic Segmentation
Type: Result
Quote: the performance gap between DynMM and ESANet becomes larger when the noise level of depth images increases; This demonstrates another advantage of DynMM in reducing data noise and improving robustness

Evidence:
- Experimental results showing DynMM's better performance under noise
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4 Semantic Segmentation
  Limitations: Limited noise types tested
  Quote: From the figure, we observe that the performance gap between DynMM and ESANet becomes larger when the noise level of depth images increases

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Tested only with Gaussian noise, limited noise scenarios, specific to one architecture comparison
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: The proposed gating function successfully identifies and handles easy vs hard examples appropriately
Location: Results/Sentiment Analysis
Type: Method Effectiveness
Quote: These results indicate that the gating function is well trained and can provide reasonable decisions based on input characteristics

Evidence:
- Analysis of gating network decisions on test instances
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.3 Sentiment Analysis
  Limitations: Qualitative analysis on limited examples
  Quote: We find that the sentences marked with red often possess strong evidence indicating the sentiments of this sample, e.g., 'horrible', 'amazingly good'. Therefore, they belong to the 'easy' samples category that can be correctly predicted using the text modality alone.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Qualitative analysis on limited examples, potential selection bias in shown examples
Confidence: medium
