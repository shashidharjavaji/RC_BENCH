On the contrary, our method achieved much better performance by pivoting the text decoder. Triplet showed good performance on table because it is relatively easy to match 1 table to N reference reviews; however, our method outperformed it. We conclude that our method lets the image and table encoder get proper representations to generate reference reviews regardless of the number of inputs."
