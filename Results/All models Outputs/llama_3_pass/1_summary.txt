=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: Statistical learners such as neural networks closely track the statistical regularities in their training sets, making them vulnerable to adopting heuristics that are valid for frequent cases but fail on less frequent ones.
Location: Introduction
Type: Methodological Limitation
Quote: Statistical learners such as neural networks closely track the statistical regularities in their training sets. This process makes them vulnerable to adopting heuristics that are valid for frequent cases but fail on less frequent ones.

Evidence:
- This process makes them vulnerable to adopting heuristics that are valid for frequent cases but fail on less frequent ones.
  Strength: weak
  Location: Section 1 Introduction
  Limitations: Lack of concrete examples

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: None

Claim 2:
Statement: We have investigated three heuristics that we hypothesize NLI models are likely to learn.
Location: Introduction
Type: Research Objective
Quote: We have investigated three heuristics that we hypothesize NLI models are likely to learn.

Evidence:
- We focus on three heuristics: the lexical overlap heuristic, the subsequence heuristic, and the constituent heuristic, all defined in Table 1.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 1 Introduction
  Limitations: None
  Quote: We focus on three heuristics: the lexical overlap heuristic, the subsequence heuristic, and the constituent heuristic, all defined in Table 1.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: None
Confidence: high

Claim 3:
Statement: We find that four existing NLI models perform very poorly on HANS, suggesting that their high accuracies on NLI test sets may be due to the exploitation of invalid heuristics rather than deeper understanding of language.
Location: Results
Type: Experimental Finding
Quote: We find that four existing NLI models perform very poorly on HANS, suggesting that their high accuracies on NLI test sets may be due to the exploitation of invalid heuristics rather than deeper understanding of language.

Evidence:
- All models achieved high scores on the MNLI test set (Figure 1a), but performed poorly on HANS (Figure 1b).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5 Results
  Limitations: None
  Quote: All models achieved high scores on the MNLI test set (Figure 1a), replicating the accuracies found in past work (DA: Gururangan et al. 2018; ESIM: Williams et al. 2018b; SPINN: Williams et al. 2018a; BERT: Devlin et al. 2019). On the HANS dataset, all models almost always assigned the correct label in the cases where the label is entailment, i.e., where the correct answer is in line with the hypothesized heuristics. However, they all performed poorly—with accuracies less than 10% in most cases, when chance is 50%—on the cases where the heuristics make incorrect predictions (Figure 1b).

- Table 7 and Table 8 show the results by subcase for models trained on MNLI for the subcases where the correct label is entailment and non-entailment, respectively.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5 Results
  Limitations: None
  Quote: Table 7 and Table 8 show the results by subcase for models trained on MNLI for the subcases where the correct label is entailment and non-entailment, respectively.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Limited to specific heuristics and models
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: These models performed significantly better on both HANS and on a separate structure-dependent dataset when their training data was augmented with HANS-like examples.
Location: Results
Type: Experimental Finding
Quote: These models performed significantly better on both HANS and on a separate structure-dependent dataset when their training data was augmented with HANS-like examples.

Evidence:
- Tables 10-14 show the results of experiments where models were trained on MNLI augmented with most HANS example categories except withholding certain categories.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section E Results with augmented training with some subcases withheld
  Limitations: None
  Quote: Tables 10-14 show the results of experiments where models were trained on MNLI augmented with most HANS example categories except withholding certain categories.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Limited to specific experiments and models
Confidence: high

Claim 5:
Statement: Our results indicate that, despite the impressive accuracies of state-of-the-art models on standard evaluations, there is still much progress to be made and that targeted, challenging datasets, such as HANS, are important for determining whether models are learning what they are intended to learn.
