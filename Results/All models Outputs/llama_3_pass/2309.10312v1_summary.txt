Claim 4:
Statement: The authors applied their framework to the GPT-4-generated explanations of GPT-2 XL neurons of Bills et al. (2023) and found high error rates and little to no causal efficacy.
Location: Section 1: Introduction
Type: Empirical Finding
Quote: We apply our framework to the GPT-4-generated explanations of GPT-2 XL neurons of Bills et al. (2023) and show that even the most confident explanations have high error rates and little to no causal efficacy.

Evidence:
- The authors applied their framework to the GPT-4-generated explanations of GPT-2 XL neurons of Bills et al. (2023) and found high error rates and little to no causal efficacy.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 1 Introduction
  Limitations: 
  Quote: We apply our framework to the GPT-4-generated explanations of GPT-2 XL neurons of Bills et al. (2023) and show that even the most confident explanations have high error rates and little to no causal efficacy.

- Experimental results showing high error rates and little to no causal efficacy for the GPT-4-generated explanations.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3 Results
  Limitations: 
  Quote: Results over 300 neuron explanations are shown in Table 1. For single neuron without probing, the GPT-4 explanations have a mean F1 score of 0.56...

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific to GPT-4-generated explanations and GPT-2 XL neurons
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Natural language explanations have inherent limitations due to vagueness, ambiguity, and context dependence.
Location: Section 5.1
Type: Theoretical Insight
Quote: However, natural languages are characterized by vagueness, ambiguity, and context dependence. These properties actually work in concert to facilitate the expressivity of language: vagueness and ambiguity allow words and phrases to be used flexibly, and context dependence means that people can coordinate on specific meanings using context.

Evidence:
- Natural language explanations have inherent limitations due to vagueness, ambiguity, and context dependence.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.1 Inherent Drawbacks to Natural Language Explanations
  Limitations: inherent limitations
  Quote: However, natural languages are characterized by vagueness, ambiguity, and context dependence.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: May not be universally applicable to all natural language explanations
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: Individual neurons may not be the best unit of analysis in terms of understanding causal effects in large language models.
Location: Section 5.2
Type: Theoretical Insight
Quote: While top-activation patterns of individual neurons provide a rough idea of what concepts are encoded in the model, isolating the effect of individual neurons on model behavior is not always feasible, as features can be distributed across multiple neurons and may be polysemantic in nature.

Evidence:
- Individual neurons may not be the best unit of analysis in terms of understanding causal effects in large language models.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4 Discussion
  Limitations: 
  Quote: High IIA@100 suggests that MLP layer neurons, when evaluated as a whole, have strong causal effects on model behavior, especially in the first layer.

- Experimental results showing that intervening on a single neuron has little to no causal effect on model behavior.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4 Discussion
  Limitations: 
  Quote: We have not found a task where intervening on a single neuron can change model behavior in a causal manner.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific to large language models
Confidence: high
