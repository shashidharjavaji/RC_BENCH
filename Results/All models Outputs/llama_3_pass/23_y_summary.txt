=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: MME is the first comprehensive MLLM evaluation benchmark that meets four distinct characteristics in terms of task type, data source, instruction design, and quantitative statistics.
Location: Abstract
Type: Novelty/Contribution
Quote: MME is the first comprehensive MLLM evaluation benchmark that meets four distinct characteristics in terms of task type, data source, instruction design, and quantitative statistics.

Evidence:
- MME covers the examination of perception and cognition abilities, including OCR, coarse-grained and fine-grained object recognition, commonsense reasoning, numerical calculation, text translation, and code reasoning.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2. MME Evaluation Suite
  Limitations: None
  Quote: MME covers the examination of perception and cognition abilities, including OCR, coarse-grained and fine-grained object recognition, commonsense reasoning, numerical calculation, text translation, and code reasoning.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high

Claim 2:
Statement: 30 advanced MLLMs are evaluated on MME, showing that there is still a large room to improve.
Location: Abstract
Type: Novelty/Contribution
Quote: 30 advanced MLLMs are evaluated on MME, showing that there is still a large room to improve.

Evidence:
- A total of 30 advanced MLLMs are evaluated on our MME, which not only suggests that existing MLLMs still have a large room for improvement, but also reveals the potential directions for the subsequent model optimization.
