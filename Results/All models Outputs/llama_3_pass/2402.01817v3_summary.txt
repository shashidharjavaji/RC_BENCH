=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: LLMs cannot plan or self-verify by themselves
Location: Abstract
Type: Limitation
Quote: We argue that auto-regressive LLMs cannot, by themselves, do planning or self-verification

Evidence:
- Results in the autonomous mode are pretty bleak. On average, only about 12% of the plans that the best LLM (GPT-4) generates are actually executable without errors and goal-reaching.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.1
  Limitations: Limited to the specific LLM (GPT-4) and planning problem instances
  Quote: Results in the autonomous mode are pretty bleak. On average, only about 12% of the plans that the best LLM (GPT-4) generates are actually executable without errors and goal-reaching.

- Two of our studies–one on plan verification (Valmeekam et al., 2023a) and the other on CSP verification (Stechly et al., 2023) seem to throw cold water on this optimism.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 2.2
  Limitations: Limited to specific studies and types of verification
  Quote: Two of our studies–one on plan verification (Valmeekam et al., 2023a) and the other on CSP verification (Stechly et al., 2023) seem to throw cold water on this optimism.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: autonomous mode, specific planning tasks
Confidence: high

Claim 2:
Statement: LLMs can play a variety of constructive roles in solving planning tasks
Location: Introduction
Type: Contribution
Quote: Accordingly, we propose a general “LLM-Modulo” framework

Evidence:
- The LLM-Modulo framework, where LLMs act as idea generators and various external critics that specialize in different aspects, critique the candidate plan.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3
  Limitations: Dependent on the effectiveness of the external critics
  Quote: The LLM-Modulo framework, where LLMs act as idea generators and various external critics that specialize in different aspects, critique the candidate plan.

- LLMs can play multiple roles in planning, including guessing candidate plans, converting those plans into syntactic forms, helping end users flesh out incomplete specifications, and helping expert users acquire domain models.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3.4
  Limitations: Limited to the specific roles identified
  Quote: LLMs can play multiple roles in planning, including guessing candidate plans, converting those plans into syntactic forms, helping end users flesh out incomplete specifications, and helping expert users acquire domain models.

Conclusion:

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: LLMs cannot generate executable plans in autonomous mode
Location: 2.1. LLMs cannot generate executable plans in autonomous mode
Type: Limitation
Quote: Despite initial claims about the planning capabilities of LLMs, several recent studies confirm that LLMs are not actually able to generate executable plans when they are used in autonomous modes

Evidence:
- Results in the autonomous mode are pretty bleak. On average, only about 12% of the plans that the best LLM (GPT-4) generates are actually executable without errors and goal-reaching.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.1
  Limitations: Limited to the specific LLM (GPT-4) and planning problem instances

Claim 4:
Statement: LLMs cannot verify plans and thus cannot improve by self-critiquing
Location: 2.2. LLMs cannot verify plans and thus cannot improve by self-critiquing
Type: Limitation
Quote: There still exists considerable optimism that even if LLMs can’t generate correct solutions in one go, their accuracy might improve in an iterative prompting regime

Evidence:
- Two of our studies–one on plan verification (Valmeekam et al., 2023a) and the other on CSP verification (Stechly et al., 2023) seem to throw cold water on this optimism.
  Strength: moderate

Claim 5:
Statement: LLMs can be used as approximate knowledge sources for planning tasks
Location: 2.3. Analyzing Claims to the Contrary in the Literature
Type: Contribution
Quote: The fact that LLMs are often good at extracting planning knowledge can indeed be gainfully leveraged

Evidence:
- LLMs can be a rich source of approximate models of world/domain dynamics and user preferences, as long as the humans (and any specialized critics) in the loop verify and refine those models, and give them over to model-based solvers.
  Strength: moderate

Claim 6:
Statement: The LLM-Modulo framework can improve planning performance
Location: 3. LLM-Modulo Framework for Robust Planning
Type: Contribution

Evidence:
- Our preliminary results on adapting LLM-Modulo framework to this benchmark are reported in (Gundawar et al., 2024). The benchmark’s authors test LLMs across a variety of prompt engineering techniques including Chain of Thought and ReAct, reporting that–on GPT-3.5-Turbo–the current best strategies only manage a startlingly low 0.7% performance rate!
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: Limited to the specific benchmark and LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo)
