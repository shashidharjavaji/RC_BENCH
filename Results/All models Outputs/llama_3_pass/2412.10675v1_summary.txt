Claim 1:
Statement: Fine-tuning LLMs on a corpus of planning instances does not lead to robust planning skills, as indicated by poor performance on out-of-distribution test sets.
Location: Abstract
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: Fine-tuning LLMs on a corpus of planning instances does not lead to robust planning skills, as indicated by poor performance on out-of-distribution test sets.

Evidence:
- Table 1 presents the performance of our fine-tuned LLM across various test sets with no additional strategies applied. Although the LLM performs well on in-distribution, it struggles to generalize to OOD cases.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: Only shows performance on specific test sets
  Quote: Table 1 presents the performance of our fine-tuned LLM across various test sets with no additional strategies applied. Although the LLM performs well on in-distribution, it struggles to generalize to OOD cases.

  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Only shows average performance across all domains

Claim 3:
Statement: Reinforcement learning (RL) with the novel 'Longest Contiguous Common Subsequence' (LCCS) reward emerges as the most effective strategy, contributing to both plan executability and validity.
Location: Abstract
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: Among the strategies we evaluated, reinforcement learning with our novel ‘Longest Contiguous Common Subsequence’ (LCCS) reward emerged as the most effective, contributing to both plan executability and validity.

Evidence:

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.7
  Limitations: Only shows performance on the 'long' test set
  Quote: RL emerges as the most effective strategy, contributing to both plan executability and validity, with a 6.7% increase in validity rate and a 9.0% increase in executability rate on the 'long' test set.

Claim 5:
Statement: Permutation augmentation enhances the executability rate, particularly in the 'unseen' test set, with a score of 75.5%.
Location: Section 4.2
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: While this technique does not significantly improve the validity rate, it largely enhances the executability rate (see Table 2 row 2). In particular, we observe a remarkable 75.5% score in “unseen” test set, while the vanilla model only got 20.1% (row 1).

Evidence:
- Permutation augmentation enhances the executability rate, particularly in the 'unseen' test set, with a score of 75.5%.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: Only shows performance on the 'unseen' test set
  Quote: Permutation augmentation enhances the executability rate, particularly in the 'unseen' test set, with a score of 75.5%.

Evidence:
- Goal CoT hinders planning performance among OOD cases, showing no improvement whatsoever, as shown in Table 2.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.3

Statement: The model recognizes mistakes but fails to correct them, as shown by high precision and recall rates in probing tests.
Location: Section 4.4
Type: Limitation
Quote: Despite high initial expectations for self-correction learning – stemming from its demonstrated effectiveness in solving math problems – this recently proposed strategy did not improve validity rates (see Table 2 row 6, 7, 8, 9).

Evidence:
- The model recognizes mistakes but fails to correct them, as shown by high precision and recall rates in probing tests, with a precision of 90.5% and recall of 99.2%.

Claim 8:

Location: Section 4.5
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: We observed that State CoT does not improve plan executability within the ‘long’ test set, yet it significantly enhances performance within the ‘unseen’ test set (e.g., 100% in row 4).

Statement: RL enhances model performance, especially on longer problems, with a 6.7% increase in validity rate and a 9.0% increase in executability rate on the 'long' test set.
Location: Section 4.7
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: RL notably improves the performance under our end-to-end planning paradigm, especially on longer problems. Note that the model was trained on 10% of the ‘long’ test set with the proposed LCCS-based reward model, and evaluated on the 90% of the ‘long’ test set and other OOD test sets.
