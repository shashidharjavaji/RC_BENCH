The researchers introduce a novel dataset, SelfAware, consisting of unanswerable questions from five diverse categories and their answerable counterparts. They also propose an automated methodology to detect uncertainty in the models' responses. The results show that while LLMs possess some degree of self-knowledge, there is still a significant gap between their capabilities and human proficiency in recognizing the limits of their knowledge.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Self-Knowledge in LLMs:** The study reveals that LLMs have an intrinsic capacity for self-knowledge, which can be enhanced through in-context learning and instruction tuning.\n2. **Dataset:** The researchers introduce the SelfAware dataset, comprising 1,032 unanswerable questions and 2,337 answerable questions, to evaluate LLMs' self-knowledge.\n3. **Evaluation Methodology:** The study proposes an automated method to detect uncertainty in LLMs' responses, using a text similarity algorithm and a reference sentence set.\n4. **Comparison with Human Self-Knowledge:** The results show a noticeable gap between the self-knowledge of LLMs (best model: 75.47% F1 score) and human self-knowledge (84.93% F1 score).\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n1. **Dataset Construction:** The SelfAware dataset was constructed by collecting unanswerable questions from online platforms and answerable questions from existing datasets (SQuAD, HotpotQA, and TriviaQA).\n2. **Evaluation Method:** The researchers used a text similarity algorithm (SimCSE) to compute the similarity between target sentences and a reference sentence set, with a threshold of 0.75.\n3. **Experiments:** The study evaluated 20 LLMs, including GPT-3, InstructGPT, and LLaMA, using three input forms: Direct, Instruction, and In-Context Learning (ICL).\n\n**Limitations and Future Work:**\n\n1. **Generalization of Reference Sentences:** The study acknowledges the potential limitation of using reference sentences exclusively from the GPT-3 and InstructGPT series.\n2. **Limitations of Input Forms:** The researchers suggest exploring additional cognitive and decision-making methods to delve deeper into LLMs' self-knowledge.\n3. **Ethics Statement:** The study emphasizes the importance of privacy, data security, and compliance with dataset licenses, ensuring that the research methodologies align with ethical standards.",
