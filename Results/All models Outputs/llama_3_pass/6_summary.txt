Claim 2:
Statement: Retrieving nearest neighbors from data can be a substitute for training on it.
Location: Section 4.2
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: Table 3 shows that, as expected, the model trained on 3B tokens dramatically outperforms the model trained on 100M tokens, improving perplexity from 19.59 to 15.17. However, adding nearest neighbors retrieval over those 3B examples to the model trained on 100M tokens improves perplexity from 19.59 to 13.73; i.e. retrieving nearest neighbors from the corpus outperforms training on it.

Evidence:
- Table 3 shows that, as expected, the model trained on 3B tokens dramatically outperforms the model trained on 100M tokens, improving perplexity from 19.59 to 15.17. However, adding nearest neighbors retrieval over those 3B examples to the model trained on 100M tokens improves perplexity from 19.59 to 13.73; i.e. retrieving nearest neighbors from the corpus outperforms training on it.
  Strength: strong

  Limitations: Specific to WIKI-3B and WIKI-100M datasets

Claim 3:
Statement: kNN-LM allows a single model to be useful in multiple domains, by simply adding a datastore per domain.
Location: Section 4.3
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: Table 4 shows that an in-domain LM on BOOKS has a relatively low perplexity (11.89), while a model trained on WIKI-3B performs poorly on the BOOKS domain (34.84 perplexity). Adding kNN search over BOOKS to the WIKI-3B model reduces perplexity by 14 points (to 20.47), demonstrating that kNN-LM allows a single model to be useful in multiple domains, by simply adding a datastore per domain.

Claim 4:
Statement: The Transformer LM is very good at learning a representation function for contexts with an implicit notion of similarity.
Location: Section 6
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: We conjecture that kNN-LM improves performance because (1) the Transformer LM is very good at learning a representation function for contexts with an implicit notion of similarity, and (2) while the Transformer has capacity to memorize all training examples, doing so causes its representation to generalize less effectively, but (3) the kNN-LM allows the model to memorize the training data while retaining an effective similarity function.

Evidence:

  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6
  Limitations: Based on experimental results and analysis
