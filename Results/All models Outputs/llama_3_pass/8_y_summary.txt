=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: MultimodalSum introduces a novel approach to self-supervised multimodal opinion summarization.
Location: Introduction
Type: Methodological
Quote: Our study introduces a novel approach to self-supervised multimodal opinion summarization, leveraging both text and image modalities to enhance summary quality.

Evidence:
- Our framework can reflect text, images, and metadata together as an extension of the existing self-supervised opinion summarization framework.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 8 Conclusions
  Limitations: None mentioned
  Quote: Our framework can reflect text, images, and metadata together as an extension of the existing self-supervised opinion summarization framework.

- MultimodalSum showed superior results compared with extractive and abstractive baselines for both token-level and document-level measures.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 7.1.1 Automatic Evaluation
  Limitations: Limited to Yelp and Amazon datasets
  Quote: MultimodalSum showed superior results compared with extractive and abstractive baselines for both token-level and document-level measures.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high

Claim 2:
Statement: MultimodalSum outperforms state-of-the-art models in evaluations.
Location: Introduction
Type: Result-based
Quote: This method, named MultimodalSum, outperforms state-of-the-art models in both automatic and human evaluations on the Yelp dataset.

Evidence:
- MultimodalSum showed superior results compared with extractive and abstractive baselines for both token-level and document-level measures.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 7.1.1 Automatic Evaluation
  Limitations: Limited to Yelp and Amazon datasets
  Quote: MultimodalSum showed superior results compared with extractive and abstractive baselines for both token-level and document-level measures.

- MultimodalSum achieved state-of-the-art results on the Amazon dataset and outperformed the comparable model by a large margin in the R-L representing the ROUGE scores on the Yelp dataset.
