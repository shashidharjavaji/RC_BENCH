=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: Language models often produce hallucinated facts, and are trustworthy only once the answers are independently verified.
Location: Abstract
Type: Limitation of Language Models
Quote: Language models often produce hallucinated facts, and are trustworthy only once the answers are independently verified.

Evidence:
- Our work addresses this challenge by moving from free-form question answering to self-supported question answering, thus enabling the model itself to assist human users and raters in verifying its outputs.
  Strength: strong

Quote: Our work addresses this challenge by moving from free-form question answering to self-supported question answering.

Evidence:
- We break the task into two pieces, one mechanical and one human: special syntax that can be automatically parsed to ensure that a quote is verbatim from a source, and human preferences to determine whether the quote supports the claimed answer.
