Claim 3:
Statement: Multimodal features are more helpful than unimodal features (either text or audio) alone in predicting stock volatility.
Location: Section 7: Experiment Results and Discussion
Type: Novel finding, improvement, or advancement
Quote: We can also conclude from the results that multimodal features are more helpful than unimodal features (either text or audio) alone.

Evidence:
- We can also conclude from the results that multimodal features are more helpful than unimodal features (either text or audio) alone. When we predict the stock volatility 3-days following the conference call, multimodal (1.371) outperform unimodal (1.431) by 4.2%.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 7
  Limitations: Only for 3-day prediction
  Quote: We can also conclude from the results that multimodal features are more helpful than unimodal features (either text or audio) alone.... multimodal (1.371) outperform unimodal (1.431) by 4.2%.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: None
Confidence: high

Claim 4:
Statement: The improvement over other baseline methods is substantial, with a 54.1% gain over using past volatility only for 3-days prediction.
Location: Section 7: Experiment Results and Discussion
Type: Novel finding, improvement, or advancement
Quote: Comparing with using past volatility only, the improvement gain is as substantial as 54.1% for 3-days prediction.

Evidence:
- Comparing with using past volatility only, the improvement gain is as substantial as 54.1% for 3-days prediction.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 7
  Limitations: Only for 3-day prediction

Claim 5:
Statement: The proposed Iterative Forced Alignment (IFA) algorithm improves segmentation accuracy and reduces the degree of error significantly in aligning audio clips with corresponding text.
Location: Appendix: Iterative Forced Alignment
Type: Novel method or technique
Quote: As shown in Table 2, the adoption of IFA improves segmentation accuracy and reduces the degree of error significantly.

Evidence:
- We randomly select 200 earnings conference calls to test the effectiveness of IFA. As shown in Table 2, the adoption of IFA improves segmentation accuracy and reduces the degree of error significantly.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Appendix
  Limitations: Only tested on 200 earnings conference calls
  Quote: We randomly select 200 earnings conference calls to test the effectiveness of IFA. As shown in Table 2, the adoption of IFA improves segmentation accuracy and reduces the degree of error significantly.
