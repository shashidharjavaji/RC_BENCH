Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The evaluation of kNN-Prompt is limited to GPT-2 family models and eleven end tasks.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is a straightforward statement of the evaluation's scope, leaving no room for misinterpretation.
  Limitations: The evaluation's limitation to GPT-2 family models and eleven end tasks might not provide a comprehensive understanding of kNN-Prompt's performance across all possible models and tasks.

Claim 25:
Statement: Future work may study the usefulness of kNN-Prompt with larger inference models (i.e: GPT-3) and more diverse tasks.
Location: Section 9 Limitations

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The benefits of kNN-Prompt scale with the size of the retrieval model (Figure 5).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6
  Limitations: None mentioned in the paper
  Exact Quote: The benefits of kNN-Prompt scale with the size of the retrieval model.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Future work may study the usefulness of kNN-Prompt with larger inference models (i.e: GPT-3) and more diverse tasks.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results (Figure 5) that show a consistent trend of improved performance with increased retrieval model size. However, the robustness could be further strengthened by additional experiments with more diverse tasks and larger inference models.
  Limitations: The conclusion is based on a single figure and might not generalize to all possible tasks or scenarios. More comprehensive experiments would be necessary to fully validate the claim.

Claim 26:
Statement: Potentially, large inference models combined with larger retrieval models may result in better zero-shot performance.
Location: Section 9 Limitations

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Figure 5 shows how performance varies with the size of the retriever model on CR and MR. A size of 0 indicates that no retriever is used. Different lines represent different-sized inference models (GPT-2). The benefits of kNN-Prompt scale with the retriever model size.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6
  Limitations: Limited to specific tasks (CR and MR)
  Exact Quote: Figure 5 shows how performance varies with the size of the retriever model on CR and MR. A size of 0 indicates that no retriever is used. Different lines represent different-sized inference models (GPT-2). The benefits of kNN-Prompt scale with the retriever model size.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors suggest that combining large inference models with larger retrieval models could lead to improved zero-shot performance.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust in the sense that it consistently shows improved performance with larger retriever models across different inference model sizes. However, the analysis is limited to only two tasks (CR and MR) and does not provide a comprehensive view across all tasks evaluated in the paper.
  Limitations: The analysis is based on a limited number of tasks and does not account for potential computational trade-offs (e.g., increased memory footprint and slower retrieval with larger models).
