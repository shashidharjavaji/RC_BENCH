Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors investigate the inherent capabilities of language models in generating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths during decoding, abstaining from any specialized prompting.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes

Claim 2:
Statement: The authors find that exploring alternative top-k tokens in the decoding space reveals the natural existence of reasoning paths within these models.
Location: Introduction

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors present qualitative examples illustrating the distinctions in the generated CoTs for each method, showing that CoT-decoding exhibits a more 'free-form' CoT generation in comparison to alternative CoT prompting methods.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Appendix A
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: In Table 8, we present qualitative examples illustrating the distinctions in the generated CoTs for each method. Overall we observe that CoT-decoding exhibits a more 'free-form' CoT generation in comparison to alternative CoT prompting methods.

- Evidence Text: The authors show that CoT-decoding can better reveal what LLMs’ intrinsic strategy in solving a problem, without being influenced by the external prompts which could be biased by the prompt designers.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Appendix A
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Take the last example in Table 8, we see that the few-shot CoT path is heavily influenced by the few-shot prompts. Specifically, the few-shot prompts, sourced from (Suzgun et al., 2022), consistently follow a standard analytical approach – first assessing the person’s profession, followed by an evaluation of whether the profession aligns with the action.

- Evidence Text: The authors provide examples of CoT-decoding paths on additional tasks, demonstrating the existence of reasoning paths within the models.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Appendix B
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Table 10 provides an example where the Mistral-7B model attempts to directly solve the question with greedy decoding. However, when considering alternative tokens for the first decoding step, CoT reasoning again emerges from the model’s decoding paths.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that exploring alternative top-k tokens in the decoding space reveals the natural existence of reasoning paths within these models.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on multiple examples and tasks, showcasing the consistency of the phenomenon. However, the robustness could be further enhanced by exploring more tasks and models.
  Limitations: The study's focus on specific tasks and models might limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the evaluation of the 'free-form' CoT generation and the intrinsic strategy of LLMs might be subjective and require further clarification.

Claim 6:
Statement: The authors find that the presence of a CoT reasoning path correlates with increased model confidence in decoding its final answer.
Location: Introduction

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 1 illustrates that CoT paths do not consistently outrank non-CoT ones in the model’s probability assessment. However, they often do not represent the predominant answer among all paths, rendering methods like self-consistency inapplicable. For instance, in the GSM8K question, the prevalent answer “60”, which aligns with the greedy decoding result, fails to serve as a reliable indicator for identifying the correct path.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: CoT paths do not consistently outrank non-CoT ones in the model’s probability assessment.

- Evidence Text: Interestingly, upon examining the model’s logits, we found that the presence of a CoT path typically leads to a more confident decoding of the final answer, characterized by a significant probability disparity between the top and secondary tokens: Δ𝑘,answer = |answer| ∑︁ ∑𝑝(𝑥𝑡[1] [|][ 𝑥][<𝑡][) −] _[𝑝][(][𝑥]𝑡[2]_ [|][ 𝑥][<𝑡][)][.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: the presence of a CoT path typically leads to a more confident decoding of the final answer

- Evidence Text: Table 2 compares different ways to extract the CoT-paths out of the top-10 decoded paths. It is easy to see that the model’s own probability measure does not serve as a reliable indicator, nor does the model’s length-normalized probability (since an intuition could be a CoT-path should usually be a longer decoding path, which is not always the case, e.g., on the year parity task). In contrast, CoT-decoding can reliably extract the CoT-paths, yielding a significant boost on the model’s reasoning performance.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 2.2
  Limitations: Comparison with other methods
  Exact Quote: CoT-decoding can reliably extract the CoT-paths, yielding a significant boost on the model’s reasoning performance.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that the presence of a CoT reasoning path correlates with increased model confidence in decoding its final answer.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from multiple experiments and provides a clear explanation for the observed phenomenon. However, the analysis could be strengthened by exploring more tasks and models to increase the generalizability of the findings.
  Limitations: The study focuses on a specific set of tasks and models, which might not be representative of all possible scenarios. Further research is needed to confirm the generalizability of the findings.
