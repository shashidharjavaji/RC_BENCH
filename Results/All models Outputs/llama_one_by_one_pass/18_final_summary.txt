Claim 15:
Statement: Reflexion improves its answer accuracy in HotPotQA by using episodic memory (EPM).
Location: Section D.4

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Reflexion outperforms all baseline approaches by significant margins over several learning steps. Furthermore, ReAct-only, CoT-only, and CoT (GT)-only implementations fail to probabilistically improve on any tasks, meaning that no failed tasks from the first trial from any of the baseline approaches were able to be solved in subsequent trials using a temperature of 0.7 In the Reflexion runs, we allowed the agent to gather experience and retry on failed tasks until it produced 3 consecutive failed attempts on the particular task.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Reflexion outperforms all baseline approaches by significant margins over several learning steps.

- Evidence Text: We perform an ablation experiment to isolate the advantage of the self-reflective step for reasoning using CoT (GT) as the baseline approach. In 4, we observe that self-reflection improves learning by an 8% absolute boost over the episodic memory learning advantage.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We perform an ablation experiment to isolate the advantage of the self-reflective step for reasoning using CoT (GT) as the baseline approach.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Reflexion improves its answer accuracy in HotPotQA by using episodic memory (EPM).
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from the ablation experiment, which provides a clear comparison between Reflexion with and without EPM. The improvement in answer accuracy is statistically significant, with an 8% absolute boost.
  Limitations: The experiment only evaluates Reflexion's performance in HotPotQA and may not generalize to other tasks or environments. Additionally, the ablation experiment only compares Reflexion with and without EPM, without considering other potential factors that might influence its performance.
  Location: Section D.4

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 16:
Statement: Reflexion achieves an 8% absolute boost in learning by using self-reflection over episodic memory (EPM) in HotPotQA.
Location: Section D.4

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Figure 4: Reflexion outperforms all baseline approaches by significant margins over several learning steps. Furthermore, ReAct-only, CoT-only, and CoT (GT)-only implementations fail to probabilistically improve on any tasks, meaning that no failed tasks from the first trial from any of the baseline approaches were able to be solved in subsequent trials using a temperature of 0.7 In the Reflexion runs, we allowed the agent to gather experience and retry on failed tasks until it produced 3 consecutive failed attempts on the particular task. Naturally, the CoT (GT) achieved higher accuracy scores as it was given access to the ground truth context of the question. Still, the CoT (GT) agent is unable to correctly infer the correct answer for 39% of the questions, but Reflexion helps the agent to correct its mistakes without access to the ground truth answer to improve its accuracy by 14%.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Reflexion outperforms all baseline approaches by significant margins over several learning steps.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Reflexion achieves an 8% absolute boost in learning by using self-reflection over episodic memory (EPM) in HotPotQA.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on the performance of Reflexion in HotPotQA, which is a challenging task that requires reasoning and decision-making. The improvement in accuracy is also significant, indicating that Reflexion is effective in learning from its mistakes.
  Limitations: The evidence is limited to the specific task of HotPotQA and may not generalize to other tasks or domains. Additionally, the improvement in accuracy is based on a specific metric (14%) and may not capture the full extent of Reflexion's benefits.
