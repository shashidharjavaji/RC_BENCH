Claim 2:
Statement: The authors evaluate four popular NLI models, including BERT, a state-of-the-art model, on the HANS dataset and find that all models perform very poorly, suggesting that their high accuracies on NLI test sets may be due to the exploitation of invalid heuristics rather than deeper understanding of language.
Location: Section 5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: All models achieved high scores on the MNLI test set (Figure 1a), replicating the accuracies found in past work (DA: Gururangan et al. 2018; ESIM: Williams et al. 2018b; SPINN: Williams et al. 2018a; BERT: Devlin et al. 2019). On the HANS dataset, all models almost always assigned the correct label in the cases where the label is entailment, i.e., where the correct answer is in line with the hypothesized heuristics. However, they all performed poorly—with accuracies less than 10% in most cases, when chance is 50%—on the cases where the heuristics make incorrect predictions (Figure 1b).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5 Results
  Limitations: None

However, they all performed poorly—with accuracies less than 10% in most cases, when chance is 50%—on the cases where the heuristics make incorrect predictions (Figure 1b).

- Evidence Text: The authors conclude that despite the impressive accuracies of state-of-the-art models on standard evaluations, there is still much progress to be made and that targeted, challenging datasets, such as HANS, are important for determining whether models are learning what they are intended to learn.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 9 Conclusions
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Overall, our results indicate that, despite the impressive accuracies of state-of-the-art models on standard evaluations, there is still much progress to be made and that targeted, challenging datasets, such as HANS, are important for determining whether models are learning what they are intended to learn.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that the poor performance of NLI models on the HANS dataset suggests that their high accuracies on NLI test sets may be due to the exploitation of invalid heuristics rather than deeper understanding of language.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on the performance of multiple models on a challenging dataset. However, the conclusion relies on the assumption that the HANS dataset is a reliable measure of deeper language understanding.
  Limitations: The study only evaluates four NLI models, and the results may not generalize to other models. Additionally, the HANS dataset may not cover all aspects of language understanding.
  Location: Section 5

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Statement: The authors find that the models' poor performance on HANS is likely due to insufficient signal in the MNLI training set, rather than the models' representational capacities alone.
Location: Section 6

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The fact that SPINN did markedly better at the constituent and subsequence cases than ESIM and DA, even though the three models were trained on the same dataset, suggests that MNLI does contain some signal that can counteract the appeal of the syntactic heuristics tested by HANS.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: The fact that SPINN did markedly better at the constituent and subsequence cases than ESIM and DA, even though the three models were trained on the same dataset, suggests that MNLI does contain some signal that can counteract the appeal of the syntactic heuristics tested by HANS.

- Evidence Text: Other sources of evidence suggest that the models’ failure is due in large part to insufficient signal from the MNLI training set, rather than the models’ representational capacities alone. For example, the BERT model was found by Goldberg (2019) to achieve strong results in syntactic tasks such as subject-verb agreement prediction, a task that minimally requires a distinction between the subject and direct object of a sentence.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6
  Limitations: Dependence on Goldberg (2019) study
  Exact Quote: Other sources of evidence suggest that the models’ failure is due in large part to insufficient signal from the MNLI training set, rather than the models’ representational capacities alone.

- Evidence Text: The authors also found little evidence of compositional structure in the InferSent model, which was trained on SNLI, even though the same model type (an RNN) did learn clear compositional structure when trained on tasks that underscored the need for such structure.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6
  Limitations: Dependence on InferSent model study
  Exact Quote: The authors also found little evidence of compositional structure in the InferSent model, which was trained on SNLI, even though the same model type (an RNN) did learn clear compositional structure when trained on tasks that underscored the need for such structure.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that the models' poor performance on HANS is likely due to insufficient signal in the MNLI training set, rather than the models' representational capacities alone.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it comes from multiple sources, including the performance of different models on HANS and the results of other studies on syntactic tasks. However, the conclusion could be further strengthened by exploring more models and training datasets to confirm the trend.
  Limitations: The study's focus on a specific set of heuristics and models might limit the generalizability of the findings to other NLI tasks or architectures.
  Location: Section 6

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 4:
Statement: The authors find that augmenting the training data with HANS-like examples improves the models' performance on both HANS and a separate structure-dependent dataset.
Location: Section 7

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The models performed significantly better on both HANS and on a separate structure-dependent dataset when their training data was augmented with HANS-like examples.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 7
  Limitations: None mentioned in the paper
  Exact Quote: However, these models performed significantly better on both HANS and on a separate structure-dependent dataset when their training data was augmented with HANS-like examples.

- Evidence Text: The augmentation improved performance modestly for the long examples and dramatically for the short examples, suggesting that training with HANS-like examples has benefits that extend beyond HANS.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 8
  Limitations: Only tested on one separate structure-dependent dataset
  Exact Quote: The augmentation improved performance modestly for the long examples and dramatically for the short examples, suggesting that training with HANS-like examples has benefits that extend beyond HANS.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Augmenting the training data with HANS-like examples improves the models' performance on both HANS and a separate structure-dependent dataset.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it shows consistent improvement across different types of examples (short and long) and across different datasets (HANS and a separate structure-dependent dataset). However, the robustness could be further strengthened by testing with more diverse datasets and evaluating the long-term effects of such augmentation.
  Limitations: The study does not explore the optimal amount of HANS-like examples needed for significant improvement, nor does it delve into potential overfitting issues that might arise from adding a large number of specific examples to the training set.
  Location: Section 7

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 5:
Statement: The authors conclude that statistical learners such as neural networks closely track the statistical regularities in their training sets, making them vulnerable to adopting heuristics that are valid for frequent cases but fail on less frequent ones.
Location: Section 9

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors find that four existing NLI models perform very poorly on HANS, suggesting that their high accuracies on NLI test sets may be due to the exploitation of invalid heuristics rather than deeper understanding of language.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 9
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: However, these models performed significantly better on both HANS and on a separate structure-dependent dataset when their training data was augmented with HANS-like examples.

- Evidence Text: The authors also find that the models’ poor results on HANS could arise from architectural limitations, from insufficient signal in the MNLI training set, or from both.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6
  Limitations: Insufficient signal in the MNLI training set may not be the sole cause
  Exact Quote: Other sources of evidence suggest that the models’ failure is due in large part to insufficient signal from the MNLI training set, rather than the models’ representational capacities alone.

- Evidence Text: The authors conducted experiments where they retrained each model on the MNLI training set augmented with a dataset structured exactly like HANS, and found that the models performed significantly better on HANS.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 7
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: To test that hypothesis, we retrained each model on the MNLI training set augmented with a dataset structured exactly like HANS (i.e. using the same thirty subcases) but containing no specific examples that appeared in HANS.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that statistical learners, such as neural networks, are prone to adopting heuristics that are valid for frequent cases but fail on less frequent ones, due to their tendency to closely track statistical regularities in their training sets.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a comprehensive evaluation of multiple models and datasets. The use of HANS, a specifically designed test set, adds strength to the findings. However, the reliance on a single dataset (MNLI) for augmentation and testing might be seen as a limitation.
  Limitations: The study's focus on NLI and the use of a single dataset (MNLI) for augmentation and testing might limit the generalizability of the findings to other tasks or datasets.
  Location: Section 9

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 6:
Statement: The authors introduce the HANS dataset as a tool for motivating and measuring progress in NLI.
Location: Section 9

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors conclude that there is substantial room for improvement in NLI systems, and that the HANS dataset can motivate and measure progress in this area.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 9: Conclusions
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Overall, our results indicate that, despite the impressive accuracies of state-of-the-art models on standard evaluations, there is still much progress to be made and that targeted, challenging datasets, such as HANS, are important for determining whether models are learning what they are intended to learn.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that the HANS dataset can serve as a tool for motivating and measuring progress in NLI, indicating substantial room for improvement in NLI systems.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from multiple experiments, including the evaluation of different models and the impact of dataset augmentation. However, the generalizability of the findings to other NLI tasks and datasets could be further explored.
  Limitations: The study's focus on specific syntactic heuristics might limit its generalizability to other aspects of NLI. Additionally, the reliance on a particular dataset (HANS) for evaluation might not capture the full spectrum of challenges in NLI.
  Location: Section 9

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 7:
Statement: The authors find that the models' performance on HANS is consistent with the use of the heuristics targeted in HANS, and not with the correct rules of inference.
Location: Section 5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: All four models performed very poorly on HANS, with accuracies less than 10% in most cases, when chance is 50%.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: On the HANS dataset, all models almost always assigned the correct label in the cases where the label is entailment, i.e., where the correct answer is in line with the hypothesized heuristics. However, they all performed poorly—with accuracies less than 10% in most cases, when chance is 50%—on the cases where the heuristics make incorrect predictions

- Evidence Text: The models' performance on HANS is consistent with the use of the heuristics targeted in HANS, as they nearly always predicted entailment for the examples in HANS, leading to near-perfect accuracy when the true label is entailment, and near-zero accuracy when the true label is non-entailment.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Figure 1b
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: All models behaved as we would expect them to if they had adopted the heuristics targeted by HANS. That is, they nearly always predicted entailment for the examples in HANS, leading to near-perfect accuracy when the true label is entailment, and near-zero accuracy when the true label is non-entailment.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that the models' performance on HANS is consistent with the use of the heuristics targeted in HANS, and not with the correct rules of inference.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on the models' performance across multiple cases and heuristics. The consistent pattern of results across different models and cases strengthens the conclusion.
  Limitations: None identified
  Location: Section 5

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 8:
Statement: The authors find that the models trained on MNLI with neutral and contradiction merged into a single label, non-entailment, perform similarly to the models trained on MNLI with the labels merged after training.
Location: Section D

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 9 shows the results for models trained on MNLI with neutral and contradiction merged into a single label, non-entailment. The results are similar to the results obtained by merging the labels after training, with the models generally outputting entailment for all HANS examples, whether that was the correct answer or not.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section D
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Results for models trained on MNLI with neutral and contradiction merged into a single label, non-entailment. The results are similar to the results obtained by merging the labels after training, with the models generally outputting entailment for all HANS examples, whether that was the correct answer or not.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors find that the models trained on MNLI with neutral and contradiction merged into a single label, non-entailment, perform similarly to the models trained on MNLI with the labels merged after training.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a direct comparison of the models' performance under two different training scenarios. However, the sample size and the specific models used might affect the generalizability of the results.
  Limitations: The study only examines a limited set of models and training scenarios, which might not be representative of all possible models and training approaches.
  Location: Section D

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 9:
Statement: The authors conduct human experiments using Amazon Mechanical Turk to obtain human results on the HANS dataset.
Location: Section F

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: To obtain human results, we used Amazon Mechanical Turk. We subdivided HANS into 114 different categories of examples, covering all possible variations of the template used to generate the example and the specific word around which the template was built.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section F
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: To obtain human results, we used Amazon Mechanical Turk. We subdivided HANS into 114 different categories of examples, covering all possible variations of the template used to generate the example and the specific word around which the template was built.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conducted human experiments using Amazon Mechanical Turk to obtain human results on the HANS dataset, which involved subdividing HANS into 114 categories, obtaining judgments from 5 human participants for each category, and analyzing the results.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a structured approach to collecting human judgments, ensuring a comprehensive coverage of the HANS dataset. However, the robustness could be further enhanced by increasing the number of participants or exploring additional platforms for data collection.
  Limitations: Limitations include the potential biases in participant selection and the reliance on a single platform (Amazon Mechanical Turk) for data collection.
  Location: Section F

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 10:
Statement: The authors find that the human participants achieve an average accuracy of 76% on the HANS dataset, with expert annotators achieving an average accuracy of 97%.
Location: Section F

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Our Mechanical Turk results contrast with those of Nangia and Bowman (2019), who report an accuracy of 92% in the same population on examples from MNLI; this indicates that HANS is indeed more challenging for humans than MNLI is. The difficulty of some of our examples is in line with past psycholinguistic work in which humans have been shown to incorrectly answer comprehension questions for some of our subsequence subcases.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Our Mechanical Turk results contrast with those of Nangia and Bowman (2019), who report an accuracy of 92% in the same population on examples from MNLI; this indicates that HANS is indeed more challenging for humans than MNLI is.

- Evidence Text: Crucially, although Mechanical Turk annotators found HANS to be harder overall than MNLI, their accuracy was similar whether the correct answer was entailment (75% accuracy) or non-entailment (77% accuracy).
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Crucially, although Mechanical Turk annotators found HANS to be harder overall than MNLI, their accuracy was similar whether the correct answer was entailment (75% accuracy) or non-entailment (77% accuracy).

- Evidence Text: The average accuracy was 76% for Mechanical Turk participants and 97% for expert annotators.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section F
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: The average accuracy was 76% for Mechanical Turk participants and 97% for expert annotators.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that the human participants achieve an average accuracy of 76% on the HANS dataset, with expert annotators achieving an average accuracy of 97%, indicating that HANS is more challenging for humans than MNLI.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a direct comparison between two datasets (HANS and MNLI) and includes both Mechanical Turk participants and expert annotators. The accuracy percentages provide a clear and quantifiable measure of the challenge posed by HANS.
  Limitations: The study's reliance on Mechanical Turk participants and expert annotators might introduce biases, as the population may not be representative of the broader human population. Additionally, the comparison with Nangia and Bowman's (2019) study assumes that the populations and experimental conditions are similar enough to allow for a direct comparison.
