Claim 6:
Statement: The authors find that the performance of existing LLMs deteriorates significantly as text length increases, especially in ultra-long-context settings.
Location: Section 4.2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 2 and Table 3 display the test accuracy of various LLMs on the TSort and BestAnswer tasks, respectively. The results show that the performance of existing LLMs deteriorates significantly as text length increases, especially in ultra-long-context settings.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2 and Section 4.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: For the TSort task, GPT-4-Turbo is able to achieve a random guess level accuracy, while Claude fails to give any correct answers. For BestAnswer, the performance of all three models falls sharply from 16k to 32k text length.

- Evidence Text: Table 6 demonstrates the results of LLMs on TSort and BestAnswer benchmarks in ultra-long-context settings. The results show that the evaluated models claim to understand long text up to 100,000+ tokens, but their performance deteriorates significantly in ultra-long-context settings.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: When the input length scales to 4,000 tokens, most open-source models rapidly deteriorate to random guess level. In the meanwhile, the capability of proprietary models is also severely limited. When it comes to the ultra-long setting (32,000+ tokens), no proprietary model notably outperforms the random baseline.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors find that the performance of existing LLMs deteriorates significantly as text length increases, especially in ultra-long-context settings.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from multiple experiments, covering various LLMs and evaluation tasks. The consistent decline in performance across different settings and models strengthens the conclusion.
  Limitations: The study's focus on specific tasks (TSort and BestAnswer) might not fully generalize to all long-context scenarios. Additionally, the evaluation of ultra-long-context settings is limited to a subset of models due to high API calling expenses.

Claim 7:
Statement: The authors identify two main error categories for LLMs on TSort and BestAnswer: failing to follow instructions and copying example answers.
Location: Section 4.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We further analyze the error instances on TSort and BestAnswer, and find that most errors can be attributed to two categories: 1. The LLM fails to follow the provided instruction and does not output a valid answer; 2. The LLM does output a valid answer. However, it simply copies the example answer we provide in the in-context example.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: None

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors identify two main error categories for LLMs on TSort and BestAnswer: failing to follow instructions and copying example answers.

Claim 8:
Statement: The authors find that scalable position embeddings can improve the long-context modeling capability of LLMs, with NTK-aware Scaled RoPE outperforming other methods on Vicuna-7b-v1.5.
Location: Section 4.5.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Our findings indicate that scalable position embeddings do improve the long-context modeling capability. All methods enhance the accuracy under the 8k setting, which is beyond the original context window. Concurrently, the model performance under short settings (1k, e.g.) is basically retained. NTK-aware Scaled RoPE diminishes performance on 1k context length, but outperforms other two methods on longer context.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.5.3
  Limitations: None mentioned in the provided text

  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from experiments, showing a consistent trend of improvement with NTK-aware Scaled RoPE across different context lengths.
  Limitations: The study is limited to Vicuna-v1.5 models and might not generalize to other LLM architectures. Additionally, the performance on very short contexts (1k) is diminished with NTK-aware Scaled RoPE.

Claim 9:
Statement: The authors compare Ada-LEval with other long-context benchmarks, finding that Ada-LEval requires more comprehensive text understanding than traditional QA and summarization tasks.
Location: Section 4.5.4

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: From the table 10, the performance of GPT-4-Turbo on BestAnswer decreases more dramatically than NarrativeQA and GovReport when text is truncated. Notably, the performance on GovReport even increases when text is truncated into 4k and 8k.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.5.4
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: From the table 10, the performance of GPT-4-Turbo on BestAnswer decreases more dramatically than NarrativeQA and GovReport when text is truncated. Notably, the performance on GovReport even increases when text is truncated into 4k and 8k.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Ada-LEval requires more comprehensive text understanding than traditional QA and summarization tasks.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a direct comparison of performance across different benchmarks, providing a clear indication of the relative demands of each task. However, the analysis is limited to a single model (GPT-4-Turbo) and may not generalize to all models.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to a single model (GPT-4-Turbo) and may not generalize to all models. Additionally, the comparison is based on a specific truncation approach, which might not capture all aspects of text understanding.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 10:
Statement: The authors conclude that Ada-LEval is a challenging benchmark that requires strong understanding and reasoning capabilities over long text, but has limitations in distinguishing the long-context capability of open-source LLMs due to their poor instruction following rate and copy instruction rate.
Location: Section 6

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Due to the poor instruction following rate and copy instruction rate of open-source LLMs, Ada-LEval can hardly distinguish their long-context capability through the accuracy metric.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6: Limitations
  Limitations: Difficulty in distinguishing open-source LLMs' long-context capability
  Exact Quote: Due to the poor instruction following rate and copy instruction rate of open-source LLMs, Ada-LEval can hardly distinguish their long-context capability through the accuracy metric.

  Location: Section 1: Introduction
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: In this paper, we introduce Ada-LEval, a length-adaptable dataset to assess long-context capability of LLMs.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Ada-LEval is a challenging benchmark that requires strong understanding and reasoning capabilities over long text, but has limitations in distinguishing the long-context capability of open-source LLMs due to their poor instruction following rate and copy instruction rate.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on the inherent characteristics of Ada-LEval and the performance of open-source LLMs. The conclusion is well-supported by the data, which demonstrates the benchmark's limitations in evaluating these models.
  Limitations: The conclusion is limited to the specific context of Ada-LEval and open-source LLMs. It may not generalize to other benchmarks or LLM architectures.
