Claim 2:
Statement: The authors conduct experiments on BERT-base-cased, one of the most widely-used pretrained models, to evaluate the effectiveness of their knowledge attribution method.
Location: Section 4.1

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We conduct experiments on BERT-base-cased (Devlin et al., 2019), one of the most widely-used pretrained models. It contains 12 Transformer blocks, where the hidden size is 768 and the FFN inner hidden size is 3,072.

  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We conduct experiments on BERT-base-cased (Devlin et al., 2019), one of the most widely-used pretrained models.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors evaluate the effectiveness of their knowledge attribution method using experiments on BERT-base-cased.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it specifies the model's architecture (12 Transformer blocks, hidden size of 768, and FFN inner hidden size of 3,072), providing a clear basis for the experiments. However, the robustness could be further enhanced by including results from experiments on other models to demonstrate the method's generalizability.
  Limitations: The experiments are limited to a single model (BERT-base-cased), which might not fully represent the method's capabilities across different architectures or tasks.
  Location: Section 4.1

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Statement: The authors find that the activation of knowledge neurons is positively correlated to the expression of their corresponding facts.
Location: Section 4.4

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Extensive analysis shows that the activation of such knowledge neurons is positively correlated to the knowledge expression, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge attribution method.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4
  Limitations: None mentioned
  Exact Quote: Extensive analysis shows that the activation of such knowledge neurons is positively correlated to the knowledge expression, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge attribution method.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that the activation of knowledge neurons is positively correlated to the expression of their corresponding facts, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge attribution method.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence appears robust as it is based on extensive analysis, implying a thorough examination of the relationship between knowledge neuron activation and knowledge expression. However, the robustness could be further enhanced by additional studies across different models, datasets, or tasks to confirm the generalizability of the findings.
  Limitations: The analysis might be limited to the specific dataset (PARAREL) and model (BERT-base-cased) used, potentially not fully representing all types of factual knowledge or language models. Further research could explore these aspects.

Claim 4:
Statement: The authors identify more exclusive knowledge neurons compared to the baseline method.
Location: Table 2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 2 shows the average number of pair-wise knowledge neuron intersections. For our proposed method, (1) fact pairs with the same relation (intra-relation fact pairs) share 1.23 knowledge neurons on average; (2) fact pairs with different relations (inter-relation fact pairs) share almost no knowledge neurons. In contrast, for the baseline, (3) most identified neurons are shared by intra-relation fact pairs; (4) even a substantial portion of neurons are common for inter-relation fact pairs.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Their same order of magnitude guarantees the fairness of the subsequent comparisons in the paper. We also compute the knowledge neuron intersection of different relational facts. Table 2 shows the average number of pair-wise knowledge neuron intersections. For our proposed method, (1) fact pairs with the same relation (intra-relation fact pairs) share 1.23 knowledge neurons on average; (2) fact pairs with different relations (inter-relation fact pairs) share almost no knowledge neurons. In contrast, for the baseline, (3) most identified neurons are shared by intra-relation fact pairs; (4) even a substantial portion of neurons are common for inter-relation fact pairs.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors identify more exclusive knowledge neurons compared to the baseline method.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on quantitative analysis of the average number of pair-wise knowledge neuron intersections, providing a clear comparison between the proposed method and the baseline.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific dataset (PARAREL) and the chosen baseline method. Further studies with different datasets and baseline methods could provide more comprehensive insights.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that the surgery of knowledge neurons achieves a nontrivial success rate for updating facts, while random neurons are insufficient.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a clear and measurable outcome (success rate). However, the sample size and the specific experimental setup might affect the generalizability of the results.
  Limitations: The study only examines a limited number of relations and facts, and the success rate might not be representative of all possible scenarios. Additionally, the experiment only manipulates a small number of top knowledge neurons, which might not be sufficient to fully capture the complexity of the knowledge updating process.
