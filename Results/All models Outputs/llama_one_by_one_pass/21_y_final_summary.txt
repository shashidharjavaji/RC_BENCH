Claim 9:
Statement: Common neurons tend to appear at the top layer, predominantly expressing frequently used tokens.
Location: Section 5.5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We also analyzed the token predicted by QR neurons, but we found that middle-layer neurons do not have a clear semantic meaning and human-readable concepts mostly appear in the top layer (Wendler et al. 2024).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section A
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Since the detected neurons centralize in middle layers, it is hard to interpret their predicted tokens. We may need to explore a better semantic space to study their localized regions.

- Evidence Text: Table 4 lists the predicted tokens, which include common words, punctuation marks, and option letters. These findings reinforce the notion that common neurons are not critical for specific queries.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.5
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We observe that some neurons with a relatively high attribution score are still shared across clusters. Through case studies (as shown in Table 4), we demonstrate that they express commonly used concepts such as option letters (‘‘A’’ and ‘‘B’’) or stop words (‘‘and’’ and ‘‘the’’).

- Evidence Text: We also visualize their locations within Llama-2-7B and we observe that they tend to appear at the top layer (as shown in Figure A2 in the SM).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.5
  Limitations: None
