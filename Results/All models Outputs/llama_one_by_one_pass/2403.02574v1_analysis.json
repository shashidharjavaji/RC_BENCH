Previous research on literature summarization predominantly depended on text summarization metrics, like ROUGE (Lin (2004a)). However, conventional text summary evaluation metrics such as ROUGE fall short in gauging the quality of literature summaries. It is crucial to adopt more comprehensive evaluation criteria across various dimensions to guarantee that the generated literature summaries align with the nec- essary standards. Here, inspired by G-Eval (Liu et al., 2023), we attempted to assess it using LLMs. We established six-dimensional metrics for auto- matic evaluation based on research on literature summaries (Justitia and Wang, 2022). Evaluation Steps. We used Large Language Models (LLMs) to score the six dimensions of generic quality and voted for the best summary from a series of model-generated summaries. Spe- cially, to ensure fairness and consistency in evalu- ation, we simultaneously scored and voted for the generated results of multiple models in a single conversation. Evaluation Criterion: Consistency (1-5): Content consistency between the generated summary and the gold summary. The generated summary must not contain content that conflicts with the gold summary. Coherence(1-5): The quality of language coher- ence in generated summaries, which should not just be a heap of related information. Comparative (1-5): Assess the extent to whether the generated summary conducts a compara- tive analysis on references and proposed work. Whether it provides an integrated summary of simi- lar related works. Integrity (1-5): Assess if the summary covers es- sential elements: research context, reference paper summaries, past research evaluation, contributions, and innovations. Fluency (1-5): Assess the quality of the summary in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure. Cite Accuracy(1-5): Assess whether the summary correctly cites reference paper in the format \u2018[Ref- erence i]\u2019 when mention the reference paper.",
