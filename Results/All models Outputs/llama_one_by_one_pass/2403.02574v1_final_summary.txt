--------------------------------------------------

Claim 18:
Statement: The ChatCite framework proposes an LLM-based automatic evaluation metric, G-Score.
Location: Section 1

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The evaluation of generative tasks has always been challenging. Previous research on literature summarization predominantly depended on text summarization metrics, like ROUGE (Lin (2004a)). However, conventional text summary evaluation metrics such as ROUGE fall short in gauging the quality of literature summaries. It is crucial to adopt more comprehensive evaluation criteria across various dimensions to guarantee that the generated literature summaries align with the nec- essary standards. Here, inspired by G-Eval (Liu et al., 2023), we attempted to assess it using LLMs. We established six-dimensional metrics for auto- matic evaluation based on research on literature summaries (Justitia and Wang, 2022). Evaluation Steps. We used Large Language Models (LLMs) to score the six dimensions of generic quality and voted for the best summary from a series of model-generated summaries. Spe- cially, to ensure fairness and consistency in evalu- ation, we simultaneously scored and voted for the generated results of multiple models in a single conversation. Evaluation Criterion: Consistency (1-5): Content consistency between the generated summary and the gold summary. The generated summary must not contain content that conflicts with the gold summary. Coherence(1-5): The quality of language coher- ence in generated summaries, which should not just be a heap of related information. Comparative (1-5): Assess the extent to whether the generated summary conducts a compara- tive analysis on references and proposed work. Whether it provides an integrated summary of simi- lar related works. Integrity (1-5): Assess if the summary covers es- sential elements: research context, reference paper summaries, past research evaluation, contributions, and innovations. Fluency (1-5): Assess the quality of the summary in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure. Cite Accuracy(1-5): Assess whether the summary correctly cites reference paper in the format ‘[Ref- erence i]’ when mention the reference paper.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: The evaluation of generative tasks has always been challenging. Previous research on literature summarization predominantly depended on text summarization metrics, like ROUGE (Lin (2004a)).

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The ChatCite framework proposes an LLM-based automatic evaluation metric, G-Score, which is a significant contribution to the field of literature summarization. This metric is designed to evaluate the quality of generated literature summaries across six dimensions, providing a more comprehensive assessment than traditional text summarization metrics like ROUGE.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on research on literature summaries and the development of a new evaluation metric, G-Score. The use of LLMs to score the six dimensions of generic quality adds to the robustness of the evidence, ensuring a fair and consistent evaluation process.
  Limitations: The limitations of the evidence include the reliance on LLMs for evaluation, which may introduce biases, and the potential for the G-Score metric to be influenced by the quality of the LLMs used. Additionally, the evaluation process may be time-consuming and require significant computational resources.

Claim 26:
Statement: The ChatCite model is preferred by humans over other models in literature summarization.
Location: Section 5.4

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Figure 4 demonstrates the results of G-score metric align with human preferences. Specifically, the method incorporating Key Element Extractor exhibits higher content consistency. Summaries generated with the Comparative Incremental Mechanism demonstrate better characteristics of literature review, excelling in organizational structure, comparative analysis, and citation accuracy. The fluency of results generated by LLMs is consistently high, with relatively low variation among different models.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.4 Human Study
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Figure 4 demonstrates the results of G-score metric align with human preferences.

- Evidence Text: Additionally, Figure 5 shows the extinct human preference of the ChatCite model over the others.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.4 Human Study
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Additionally, Figure 5 shows the extinct human preference of the ChatCite model over the others.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The ChatCite model is preferred by humans over other models in literature summarization.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on quantitative metrics (G-score) that align with human preferences, and the results are consistent across different aspects of literature summarization. The use of visual aids like Figure 4 and Figure 5 further strengthens the evidence by providing a clear and interpretable representation of the data.
  Limitations: The study's focus on a specific dataset and task (literature summarization) might limit the generalizability of the findings to other NLP tasks or datasets. Additionally, the evaluation is based on a specific set of human evaluators, which might not fully represent the broader preferences of the academic or research community.
