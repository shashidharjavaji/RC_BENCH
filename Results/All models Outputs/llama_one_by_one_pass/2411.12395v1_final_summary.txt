  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from experiments with two state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT 4o and 4o-mini) and a publicly available dataset (AmbigQA). The comparison of performance across different prompting methods and the fine-tuning experiment provide a comprehensive evaluation of the claim.
  Limitations: The study's focus on a specific dataset (AmbigQA) and two LLMs (GPT 4o and 4o-mini) might limit the generalizability of the findings to other datasets and LLM architectures. Additionally, the small-scale fine-tuning experiment might not fully capture the potential benefits of fine-tuning.

Claim 24:
Statement: Disambiguation via adding context performs better for both LLMs.
Location: V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Out of the two simple disambiguating methods explored, we see that disambiguation via adding context performs better for both LLMs.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
  Limitations: None mentioned in the text
  Exact Quote: Out of the two simple disambiguating methods explored, we see that disambiguation via adding context performs better for both LLMs.

- Evidence Text: TABLE I and TABLE II show the performance metrics for GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, respectively, where disambiguation via adding context has higher GT Answer Overlap values (0.789 for GPT-4o and 0.71 for GPT-4o-mini).
  Strength: moderate
  Location: TABLE I and TABLE II
  Limitations: Limited to the specific metrics and models used in the study
  Exact Quote: GT Answer Overlap values (0.789 for GPT-4o and 0.71 for GPT-4o-mini)

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Disambiguation via adding context performs better for both LLMs.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on quantitative performance metrics (GT Answer Overlap) across two different LLMs, providing a comprehensive view of the method's effectiveness. However, the robustness could be further enhanced by considering additional metrics or evaluating the method across more diverse datasets.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific LLMs (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) and the AmbigQA dataset. Generalizability to other models and datasets is assumed but not tested within this study.

Claim 25:
Statement: Fine-tuning at a small scale does not provide any improvement in LLM performance on ambiguous questions.
Location: V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: To evaluate whether small scale fine-tuning helps in improving LLM performance on ambiguous questions, we perform few-shot fine-tuning on GPT 4o-mini.... The GT Answer Overlap for the 4o-mini model is 0.643 while that for the fine-tuned 4o-mini model is 0.626.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
  Limitations: Small-scale fine-tuning, specific to GPT 4o-mini model
  Exact Quote: Therefore, we see that fine-tuning, at least at this small scale, does not provide any improvement in LLM performance on ambiguous questions.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Fine-tuning at a small scale does not provide any improvement in LLM performance on ambiguous questions.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is moderately robust as it is based on a specific experiment with a clear metric (GT Answer Overlap) but the sample size for fine-tuning (50 question-answer pairs) might be considered small, potentially affecting the generalizability of the results.
  Limitations: Small sample size for fine-tuning, limited to GPT 4o-mini model, and the experiment's focus on a specific aspect of LLM performance (ambiguous questions).

Claim 26:
Statement: Lowering the temperature value for LLM generation does not provide significant benefits in LLM performance for answering ambiguous questions.
Location: V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We show the results for this in Figure 4: we see that although lower temperature (0.2 instead of 1.0, in this case) seem to have minor improvements in some cases, the difference is not that significant.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
  Limitations: The study only tested two temperature values (1.0 and 0.2) and the results may not generalize to other temperature values.
  Exact Quote: We show the results for this in Figure 4: we see that although lower temperature (0.2 instead of 1.0, in this case) seem to have minor improvements in some cases, the difference is not that significant.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Lowering the temperature value for LLM generation does not provide significant benefits in LLM performance for answering ambiguous questions.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is moderately robust as it is based on a specific experiment with a clear outcome measure (Figure 4). However, the robustness could be improved by considering more temperature values, additional LLM models, or a larger dataset.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to a single experiment with two temperature values (1.0 and 0.2) and might not generalize to other temperature settings or LLM architectures.
