=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: The study reveals that LLMs prefer knowledge that forms a Chain of Evidence (CoE) in imperfect contexts when handling multi-hop QA.
Location: Abstract

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The study characterizes three features of CoE knowledge: intent, keywords, and relations. It then proposes a CoE discrimination approach to identify CoE from external knowledge.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We assume that LLMs prefer knowledge that forms CoE. To satisfy the two properties required for CoE formation, we characterize three features: 1) Intent describes the ultimate goal the user intends to solve through the question. 2) Keywords are important words or phrases that capture the specific details the user is asking about; and 3) Relations describe how keywords are connected to each other to convey intent.

- Evidence Text: The study evaluates the effectiveness of CoE in imperfect contexts using multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA) and finds that CoE outperforms Non-CoE variants in accuracy.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Generally, our study reveals LLMs’ preference for CoE in the imperfect context. Once CoE’s implicit relevance or interconnectivity is disrupted, the preference also decreases.

- Evidence Text: The study also investigates LLMs’ faithfulness to CoE when it contains factual errors and finds that LLMs exhibit significant faithfulness to the answer supported by CoE.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Finding-3: LLMs exhibit significant faithfulness to the answer supported by CoE although it contains factual errors.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The study reveals that LLMs prefer knowledge that forms a Chain of Evidence (CoE) in imperfect contexts when handling multi-hop QA.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a comprehensive evaluation using multiple datasets (HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA) and various LLMs. The study's findings are consistent across different experimental settings, adding to the robustness of the evidence.
  Limitations: The study's focus on multi-hop QA might limit the generalizability of the findings to other QA types. Additionally, the study does not explore the individual contributions of CoE features to LLM performance, which could provide further insights.

Claim 2:
Statement: The proposed CoE discrimination approach can effectively identify CoE from external knowledge.
Location: Section 3

Evidence:

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 6:
Statement: The study has three limitations: (1) no step to verify the correctness of answers within the CoE, (2) not investigating individual contributions of CoE features to LLM performance, and (3) the usability of the proposed retrieval strategy having inherent constraints across RAG scenarios.
Location: Limitations

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: There are three limitations to the current study. Firstly, we apply the ScopeCoE to search for CoE in external knowledge, but there is no step to verify the correctness of answers within the CoE. If the retrieved CoE contains incorrect information, it may mislead the LLM to generate inaccurate responses. In the Section 6, we discuss LLMs’ Following Rate to CoE containing factual errors, showing that LLMs are highly likely to follow the knowledge provided in CoE.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 9
  Limitations: 1) no step to verify the correctness of answers within the CoE
  Exact Quote: There are three limitations to the current study.

- Evidence Text: Secondly, this paper does not investigate the individual contributions of CoE features to LLM performance. Since intent, keywords, and relations within CoE are interdependent, it is challenging to isolate any single feature. Therefore, we focus on examining the overall impact of CoE on LLM performance in this paper.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 9
  Limitations: 2) not investigating individual contributions of CoE features to LLM performance
  Exact Quote: Secondly, this paper does not investigate the individual contributions of CoE features to LLM performance.

- Evidence Text: Thirdly, the usability of our proposed retrieval strategy (ScopeCoE) has inherent constraints across RAG scenarios. For instance, some RAG scenarios convert external knowledge into vectors and store them in vector databases, then search for question-relevant knowledge at the vector level during the retrieval phase. Our approach, which operates at the textual level, is not suitable for such vector-based RAG scenarios.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 9
  Limitations: 3) the usability of the proposed retrieval strategy having inherent constraints across RAG scenarios
  Exact Quote: Thirdly, the usability of our proposed retrieval strategy (ScopeCoE) has inherent constraints across RAG scenarios.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The study acknowledges three limitations, including the lack of verification for CoE answers, the inability to isolate individual CoE feature contributions, and the limited usability of the proposed retrieval strategy across RAG scenarios.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on the study's own methodology and findings. The limitations are clearly stated, and the explanations are concise and easy to understand.
  Limitations: None, as the limitations are already acknowledged by the authors.

Claim 9:
Statement: The study finds that LLMs exhibit higher robustness against knowledge conflict when equipped with CoE.
Location: Section 7

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 4 shows LLMs’ response accuracy (ACC) after adding misinformation to CoE and two types of Non-CoE. The results show that under CoE, the average ACC of LLMs reaches 84.1%, which is 21.4% and 15.3% higher than the SenP and WordP types under Non-CoE respectively.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 7
  Limitations: The study only evaluates the robustness of LLMs against knowledge conflict in the context of multi-hop QA.
  Exact Quote: Finding-5: LLMs augmented with CoE exhibit higher robustness against knowledge conflict than Non-CoE.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The study finds that LLMs exhibit higher robustness against knowledge conflict when equipped with CoE.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama2-13B, Llama3-70B, and Qwen2.5-32B) and two datasets (HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA). The results are consistent across different models and datasets, indicating a strong trend.
  Limitations: The study only evaluates the robustness of CoE in the context of multi-hop QA and may not generalize to other types of questions or tasks. Additionally, the study relies on a specific methodology for introducing misinformation, which might not capture all possible scenarios.
  Location: Section 7

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 10:
Statement: The study discovers that adding misinformation to CoE has a greater impact on LLM’s ability to generate correct outputs compared to adding irrelevant information.
Location: Section 7

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Finding-6: Compared to adding irrelevant information to CoE, adding misinformation has a greater impact on LLM’s ability to generate correct outputs.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 7
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: In Table 2, when adding irrelevant information from 0% to 75%, the ACC of LLMs with CoE only decreases by 1.8%. However, as shown in Table 4, introducing misinformation under similar settings results in an 18.0% ACC drop for LLMs equipped with CoE.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The study finds that adding misinformation to CoE has a more significant impact on LLM's ability to generate correct outputs than adding irrelevant information.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' performance under different conditions. The comparison between the impact of misinformation and irrelevant information provides a clear insight into the relative effects of each type of noise on LLMs.
  Limitations: The study's focus on multi-hop QA and the specific CoE discrimination approach might limit the generalizability of the findings to other QA scenarios or knowledge retrieval methods.
