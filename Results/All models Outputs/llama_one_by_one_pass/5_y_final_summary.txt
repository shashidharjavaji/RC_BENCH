Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors propose a method for obtaining feature importances from attention maps in FT-Transformer, which is a simple and efficient approach that yields reasonable feature importances.

  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a well-defined mathematical process and is evaluated using a reasonable metric (rank correlation). However, the evaluation is limited to a single dataset and may not generalize to other scenarios.
  Limitations: The method's effectiveness may depend on the specific architecture of FT-Transformer and may not be directly applicable to other models. Additionally, the evaluation is based on a single metric (rank correlation), which may not capture all aspects of feature importance.
  Location: Section 5.3

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 5:
Statement: The authors find that the proposed method for obtaining feature importances yields reasonable results and performs similarly to Integrated Gradients (IG).
Location: Section 5.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 6: Rank correlation (takes values in [−1, 1]) between permutation test’s feature importances ranking and two alternative rankings: Attention Maps (AM) and Integrated Gradients (IG). Means and standard deviations over five runs are reported.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Rank correlation (takes values in [−1, 1]) between permutation test’s feature importances ranking and two alternative rankings: Attention Maps (AM) and Integrated Gradients (IG). Means and standard deviations over five runs are reported.

- Evidence Text: Interestingly, the proposed method yields reasonable feature importances and performs similarly to IG (note that this does not imply similarity to IG’s feature importances). Given that IG can be orders of magnitude slower and the “baseline” in the form of PT requires (nfeatures + 1) forward passes (versus one for the proposed method), we conclude that the simple averaging of attention maps can be a good choice in terms of cost-effectiveness.
  Strength: strong
