Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The FEEDBACK COLLECTION holds a smoothly increasing sentiment tendency for each score description.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a clear and objective visual representation (Figure 8) that directly illustrates the sentiment trend. However, the analysis could be further strengthened by including additional metrics or statistical tests to confirm the observed trend.
  Limitations: The analysis relies solely on visual inspection of Figure 8 and may benefit from supplementary quantitative analysis to reinforce the conclusion.

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section D
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: As shown in Figure 9, most of the responses within the FEEDBACK COLLECTION maintained a similar length among different scores (near 200 tokens).

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The FEEDBACK COLLECTION maintains a similar length among the score range of 1 to 5.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a visual representation of the data, which is less prone to interpretation errors. However, the analysis could be further strengthened by providing additional metrics, such as statistical measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and dispersion (e.g., standard deviation, interquartile range).
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the provided figure and does not account for potential outliers or responses with significantly different lengths. Additionally, the conclusion assumes that a similar length across scores is desirable, which might not always be the case, depending on the specific evaluation context.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The FEEDBACK COLLECTION showcases a notable range of expressions in its instructions, responses, and feedback.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on quantitative analysis of the dataset's linguistic features. The use of bigram and trigram ratios provides a reliable measure of diversity.
  Limitations: The analysis only considers the linguistic features of the dataset and does not account for other aspects, such as the semantic meaning or context of the expressions.

Claim 10:
Statement: The FEEDBACK BENCH is valid to be claimed as an unseen test set to measure the evaluation capability of evaluator LMs.
Location: Section E

Evidence:

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section E
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Figure 10 shows a low overlap among the train and test sets, confirming that the FEEDBACK BENCH is valid to be claimed as an unseen test set to measure the evaluation capability of evaluator LMs.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The FEEDBACK BENCH is valid to be claimed as an unseen test set to measure the evaluation capability of evaluator LMs.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a quantitative measure (rouge-L distribution) that objectively assesses the similarity between the train and test sets. However, the robustness could be improved by considering additional metrics or evaluating the FEEDBACK BENCH on multiple aspects.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to a single metric (rouge-L distribution) and may not capture other important aspects of the FEEDBACK BENCH. Additionally, the conclusion relies on the assumption that a low overlap between the train and test sets is a sufficient condition for a test set to be considered unseen.
