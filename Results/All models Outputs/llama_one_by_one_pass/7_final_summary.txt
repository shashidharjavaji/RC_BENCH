Claim 7:
Statement: The encoder and retriever both benefit from REALM training separately, but the best result requires both components acting in unison.
Location: Section 4.5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We first aim to determine whether REALM pre-training improves the retriever or the encoder, or both. To do so, we can reset the parameters of either the retriever or the encoder to their baseline state before REALM pre-training, and feed that into fine-tuning. Resetting both the retriever and encoder reduces the system to our main baseline, ORQA.

Claim 8:
Statement: Salient span masking is crucial for REALM, as it provides a consistent learning signal.
Location: Section 4.5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We compare our salient span masking scheme (Section 3.4) with (1) random token masking introduced in BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and (2) random span masking proposed by SpanBERT (Joshi et al., 2019). While such salient span masking has not been shown to be impactful in previous work with standard BERT training (Joshi et al., 2019), it is crucial for REALM.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.5
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: While such salient span masking has not been shown to be impactful in previous work with standard BERT training (Joshi et al., 2019), it is crucial for REALM.

Claim 9:
Statement: Frequent index refreshes are important for model training, as a stale index can hurt model training.
Location: Section 4.5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 2 shows the results of ablating critical components of REALM on NaturalQuestions-Open. The results indicate that using a stale MIPS index (30× stale MIPS) significantly hurts model training, with a decrease in exact match from 38.5 to 28.7.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.5
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: 30× stale MIPS 28.7 15.1

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Frequent index refreshes are important for model training, as a stale index can hurt model training.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from an ablation study, which is a reliable method for evaluating the importance of a specific component in a complex system. The results are also consistent with the expected outcome, adding to the robustness of the evidence.
  Limitations: The study only evaluates the impact of a stale index on one specific task (NaturalQuestions-Open) and may not generalize to other tasks or datasets. Additionally, the study only examines the effect of a 30× stale index and does not provide insights into the optimal refresh rate.

Claim 10:
Statement: REALM can be viewed as a generalization of language representation models that condition on surrounding words, sentences, and paragraphs to the entire text corpus.

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5. Discussion and Related Work
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Language representation models have been incorporating contexts of increasingly large scope when making predictions. Examples of this progression include models that condition on surrounding words (Mikolov et al., 2013a;b), sentences (Kiros et al., 2015; Peters et al., 2018), and paragraphs (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018). We can view REALM as a generalization of the above work to the next level of scope: the entire text corpus.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: REALM can be viewed as a generalization of language representation models that condition on surrounding words, sentences, and paragraphs to the entire text corpus.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it directly addresses the claim and provides a clear explanation for the generalization. The language used is also concise and unambiguous, leaving little room for misinterpretation.
  Limitations: None apparent in this specific context, but potential limitations could arise from the broader implications of generalizing language representation models to the entire text corpus, such as increased computational complexity or the need for vast amounts of training data.

Claim 11:
Statement: REALM has a similar approach to retrieve-and-edit frameworks, except that the model learns for itself which texts are most useful for reducing perplexity.

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5. Discussion and Related Work
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Retrieve-and-edit with learned retrieval. In order to better explain the variance in the input text and enable controllable generation, Guu et al. (2018) proposed a language model with the retrieve-and-edit framework (Hashimoto et al., 2018) that conditions on text with high lexical overlap. REALM has a similar approach, except that the model learns for itself which texts are most useful for reducing perplexity.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: REALM has a similar approach to retrieve-and-edit frameworks, except that the model learns for itself which texts are most useful for reducing perplexity.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is a clear and direct comparison made within the text, leaving little room for misinterpretation. The strength of the evidence lies in its straightforwardness and the lack of any contradictory information in the surrounding context.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: REALM's document index can be viewed as a memory where the keys are the document embeddings, enabling sub-linear memory access.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a clear and logical analogy, making the conclusion well-supported.

Claim 13:
Statement: REALM generates text with latent selection of relevant documents, offering a set of model-centric unsupervised alignments between text in the pre-training corpus and knowledge corpus.
Location: Section 5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: In sequence-to-sequence models with attention (Bahdanau et al., 2014), text is generated with latent selection of relevant tokens. This results in a set of model-centric unsupervised alignments between target and source tokens. Analogously, REALM also generates text with latent selection of relevant documents.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5. Discussion and Related Work
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Analogously, REALM also generates text with latent selection of relevant documents, offering a set of model-centric unsupervised alignments between text in the pre-training corpus and knowledge corpus.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: REALM generates text with latent selection of relevant documents, offering a set of model-centric unsupervised alignments between text in the pre-training corpus and knowledge corpus.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a well-established concept in natural language processing (sequence-to-sequence models with attention) and applies it to REALM in a logical and coherent manner.
  Limitations: The analogy might not capture all nuances of REALM, and the conclusion relies on the assumption that the latent selection process in REALM is similar to that in sequence-to-sequence models.
