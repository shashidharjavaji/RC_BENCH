Claim 4:
Statement: Learning from human preferences improves GopherCite decisively over purely supervised baselines.
Location: Section 3.1

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 1 and Table 2
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Learning from human preferences improves GopherCite decisively over purely supervised baselines. Both reranking with a reward model, as well as reinforcement learning, significantly improve scores achieved by the models on both evaluation datasets, compared to purely supervised models trained on our Rated-Good samples.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Learning from human preferences improves GopherCite decisively over purely supervised baselines, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2. The results demonstrate that both reranking with a reward model and reinforcement learning significantly improve scores achieved by the models on both evaluation datasets, compared to purely supervised models trained on Rated-Good samples.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a thorough evaluation of the model's performance on two different datasets (NaturalQuestionsFiltered and ELI5Filtered). The results are consistent across both datasets, indicating that the improvement is not dataset-specific.

  Location: Section 3.1

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 5:
Statement: Declining to answer substantially improves these numbers by answering only selected questions whilst still attempting a large majority.
Location: Section 3.1

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Figure 4 shows the resulting trade-off. Declining to answer some percentage of questions using the reward model results in higher Supported&Plausible human ratings on the resulting subset of attempted questions, and the reward model improves over the two likelihood baselines.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Declining to answer some percentage of questions using the reward model results in higher Supported&Plausible human ratings on the resulting subset of attempted questions, and the reward model improves over the two likelihood baselines.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Declining to answer substantially improves the model's performance by answering only selected questions while still attempting a large majority.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from Figure 4, which shows a consistent trend across different models and datasets. However, the robustness could be affected by the specific implementation of the reward model and the datasets used.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific models and datasets used in the study. Further research is needed to generalize these findings to other models and datasets.

  Location: Section 3.7
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Table 4 shows that when evaluated on the TruthfulQA benchmark Lin et al. (2021), GopherCite achieves high Supported&Plausible results but does not score well in the Truthful&Informative objective defined for the dataset.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that their models show no improvements in truthfulness per the definition from TruthfulQA, as evidenced by the results in Table 4.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a benchmark evaluation (TruthfulQA) and provides a clear measure of the model's performance in terms of truthfulness. However, the evidence may be limited by the specific evaluation setup and the definition of truthfulness used in the TruthfulQA dataset.
  Limitations: The evaluation is limited to the TruthfulQA dataset and may not generalize to other datasets or evaluation settings. Additionally, the definition of truthfulness used in the TruthfulQA dataset may not capture all aspects of truthfulness.

  Location: Section 2.4
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Our approach to finetuning follows Christiano et al. (2017); Stiennon et al. (2020); Ziegler et al. (2019). The entire project iterated over the steps below until the desired performance was reached (illustrated in Figure 3).

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors' conclusion that the GopherCite model, trained using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning, outperforms purely supervised baselines is justified.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 13:
Statement: The authors propose a mechanism for declining to answer, which allows the model to abstain from answering when the reward model score falls below a certain threshold.
Location: Section 2.9

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Declining to answer. By choosing a threshold for likelihood or reward below which the system will answer “I don’t know” we can increase the proportion of attempted answers that are supported and plausible. Here we show the % of questions where an answer is attempted (𝑥-axis) vs. the % of answers deemed Supported&Plausible amongst those attempted (𝑦-axis). The dashed lines indicate performance achieved by our best model when attempting all the questions.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: None

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The proposed mechanism for declining to answer allows the model to abstain from answering when the reward model score falls below a certain threshold, thereby increasing the proportion of attempted answers that are supported and plausible.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from the proposed mechanism. The results show a clear trend of increasing supported and plausible answers with the chosen threshold.
  Limitations: The proposed mechanism relies on the reward model's ability to accurately predict the quality of answers. If the reward model is biased or inaccurate, the mechanism may not effectively increase the proportion of supported and plausible answers.
