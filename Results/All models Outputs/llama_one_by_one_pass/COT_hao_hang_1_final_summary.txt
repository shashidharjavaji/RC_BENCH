Location: Section A.3

Evidence:

  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on the fundamental concept of chain-of-thought prompting. However, the strength of the evidence relies on the assumption that the 'chain of thought' approach can be effectively applied to various tasks, which might not always be the case.
  Limitations: The conclusion's applicability might be limited to tasks that inherently require multi-step reasoning or problem-solving, and the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting might vary across different tasks and domains.

Claim 6:
Statement: Chain-of-thought prompting is more helpful for some tasks than others, and its benefits are largest when three conditions are met: the task is challenging and requires multi-step reasoning, a large language model is used, and the scaling curve is relatively flat.
Location: Section A.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The performance gain from chain-of-thought prompting is largest for PaLM 540B on GSM8K (challenging multi-step problems, flat scaling curve), which meets these conditions. The performance gain is small for the subsets of MAWPS that only require one or two steps (SingleOP, SingleEq, and AddSub), for which PaLM 540B already achieves performance of 90% or higher (and it is also generally true that there is less headroom for improvement when performance is already strong).
  Strength: strong

  Limitations: None

Claim 7:
Statement: The success of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale is a complicated phenomenon that likely involves a variety of emergent abilities.
Location: Section A.1

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Scaling up language models has been shown to confer benefits such as improved performance and sample efficiency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent in the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale models, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section A.1
  Limitations: None
