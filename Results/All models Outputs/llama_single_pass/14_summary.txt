Claim 4:
Type: methodology
Statement: RETRO models can exploit dataset leakage, but also provide a path towards mitigating privacy concerns
Location: Section A
Exact Quote: However, retrieval systems offer a path towards mitigating these concerns via obliteration of the retrievable data at inference time.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Section A
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section A
  Limitations: Discussion is conceptual and not empirically validated within the paper

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The discussion provides a conceptual framework for addressing privacy concerns but lacks empirical validation within the paper.
Key Limitations: Lack of empirical validation
