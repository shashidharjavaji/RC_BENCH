Claim 1:
Type: contribution/performance
Statement: In-context impersonation reveals Large Language Models’ strengths and biases
Location: Title
Exact Quote: In-Context Impersonation Reveals Large Language Models’ Strengths and Biases

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experiments on two-armed bandit, reasoning, and vision-language tasks
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: Limited to specific tasks and personas
  Exact Quote: Using Vicuna-13B, we evaluate the two-armed bandit and MMLU language reasoning tasks. For the zero-shot image classification task using a VLM we generate descriptions with both Vicuna-13B and ChatGPT.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The experiments provide strong evidence for the claim, demonstrating the impact of in-context impersonation on LLM performance and biases across various tasks.
Key Limitations: Task and persona specificity

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: LLMs can recover human-like developmental stages of exploration in a two-armed bandit task
Location: Section 4.1
Exact Quote: Asking LLMs to impersonate differently aged people in a two-armed bandit task, LLMs could reproduce human-like developmental stages of exploration behavior.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Analysis of regression weights and exploration strategies for different age groups
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: Limited to two-armed bandit task
  Exact Quote: Figure 2 (bottom right) reveals that LLMs pretending to be older explored their environment less (β = 0.03, p <.001) and exploited more (β = 0.04, p <.001) in the ages between 2–20.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The analysis of regression weights and exploration strategies provides strong evidence for the claim, demonstrating the ability of LLMs to recover human-like developmental stages.
Key Limitations: Task specificity

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: Impersonation can boost relative performance and recover societal biases in vision-language tasks
Location: Section 4.3
Exact Quote: Asking LLMs to impersonate various roles in a vision-language task revealed not only that impersonation can boost relative performance but also recovered societal biases about a person’s age, gender, and race.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experiments on Caltech UCSD Birds and Stanford Cars datasets
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Limited to specific datasets and tasks
  Exact Quote: Our results in Figure 4 show that across all three CLIP variants increased age in the impersonated persona increases performance for both bird and car classification.

- Evidence Text: Analysis of biases in LLM descriptions for different personas
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Limited to specific personas and biases
  Exact Quote: We observe that impersonation can reveal biases encoded in the LLMs, such as racial and gender biases.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The experiments provide moderate to strong evidence for the claim, demonstrating the impact of impersonation on performance and biases in vision-language tasks.
Key Limitations: Dataset and task specificity, persona specificity
