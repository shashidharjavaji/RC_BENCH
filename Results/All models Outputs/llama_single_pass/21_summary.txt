Claim 1:
Type: contribution
Statement: Knowledge neurons in pretrained Transformers can be identified and analyzed.
Location: Section 1: Introduction
Exact Quote: We present preliminary studies on how factual knowledge is stored in pretrained Transformers by introducing the concept of knowledge neurons.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experimental results on the PARAREL dataset show that knowledge neurons are positively correlated with knowledge expression.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4: Experiments
  Limitations: Limited to the PARAREL dataset and the fill-in-the-blank cloze task.
  Exact Quote: Figure 3 presents the layer distribution of knowledge neurons identified by our knowledge attribution method.

- Evidence Text: Case studies on updating facts and erasing relations demonstrate the potential applications of knowledge neurons.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5: Case Studies
  Limitations: Preliminary and limited to specific relations and facts.
  Exact Quote: Table 5: Case studies of erasing relations.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence from the experiments and case studies supports the claim that knowledge neurons can be identified and analyzed in pretrained Transformers.
Key Limitations: Dataset and task limitations.

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: The proposed knowledge attribution method is effective in identifying knowledge neurons.
Location: Section 3: Identifying Knowledge Neurons
Exact Quote: We propose a knowledge attribution method based on integrated gradients.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Comparison with the baseline method shows that the proposed method identifies more exclusive knowledge neurons.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3: Attribution Baseline
  Limitations: Comparison is limited to a specific baseline method.
  Exact Quote: Table 2: Statistics of knowledge neurons.

- Evidence Text: The method's effectiveness is also demonstrated through the analysis of knowledge neuron intersections.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.3: Attribution Baseline
  Limitations: Limited to the analysis of intersections.
  Exact Quote: Table 2: Statistics of knowledge neurons.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim that the proposed knowledge attribution method is effective.
Key Limitations: Baseline comparison limitations.

Claim 3:
Type: contribution
Statement: Knowledge neurons can be leveraged to edit factual knowledge in pretrained Transformers.
Location: Section 5: Case Studies
Exact Quote: We present two preliminary studies to demonstrate the potential applications of knowledge neurons.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Case study on updating facts shows a non-trivial success rate.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.1: Updating Facts
  Limitations: Preliminary and limited to specific facts and relations.
  Exact Quote: Table 6: Case studies of updating facts.

- Evidence Text: Case study on erasing relations shows a significant increase in perplexity for the erased relation.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.2: Erasing Relations
  Limitations: Preliminary and limited to specific relations.
  Exact Quote: Table 5: Case studies of erasing relations.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: moderate
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence from the case studies supports the claim that knowledge neurons can be leveraged to edit factual knowledge.
Key Limitations: Preliminary nature and specific focus of the case studies.
