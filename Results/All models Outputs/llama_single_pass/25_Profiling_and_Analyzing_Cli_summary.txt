Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: The paper proposes a new method to extract and profile climate change statements from IPCC reports.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: We propose new methods to extract and profile the climate change statements from the Sixth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors develop a tool to extract scientific statements, represent them as faceted tuples, and analyze their distributions.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Methods
  Limitations: Limited to AR6 reports
  Exact Quote: We design and implement a tool to extract scientific statements from IPCC Working Group (WG) reports.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The method provides a novel approach to extracting and profiling climate change statements.
Key Limitations: Limited scope

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: contribution
Statement: The extracted statements offer comprehensive coverage of climate change-related findings.
Location: Results
Exact Quote: The overall distribution aligns with observations on integrative assessment â€“ confidence is most applicable when characterizing statements in WGII (on impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability).

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors analyze the distributions of statements, confidence levels, and likelihoods, providing insights into the robustness and reliability of climate change information.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Results
  Limitations: Limited to AR6 reports
  Exact Quote: The majority of the statements in C are found within the chapter bodies. Over 90% of the overall statements have confidence levels above medium.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The analysis demonstrates the comprehensiveness of the extracted statements.
Key Limitations: Limited scope

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: contribution
Statement: The paper highlights the potential for collaboration between climate scientists, linguists, and policymakers.
Location: Discussion
Exact Quote: We believe that further engaging in crossdisciplinary collaborations involving climate scientists and linguists can enhance our interpretation of statements and help pave the way for designing tools that can ultimately help scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors demonstrate the value of interdisciplinary collaboration in enhancing the interpretation of statements and informing decision-making.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Discussion
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We aim to enable more informed decision-making and foster a deeper understanding of climate change dynamics.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The paper showcases the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration.
Key Limitations: None
