Claim 1:
Type: Contribution
Statement: LLMs possess a certain degree of self-knowledge, enabling them to identify unanswerable questions.
Location: Section 4, Experiment
Exact Quote: Our results reveal that while these models possess a certain degree of self-knowledge...

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experimental results on 20 LLMs, including GPT-3, InstructGPT, and LLaMA
  Strength: Strong
  Location: Section 4, Experiment

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: Methodology
Statement: In-context learning and instruction tuning can enhance the self-knowledge of LLMs.
Location: Section 4, Analysis
Exact Quote: Our analysis indicates that an LLMâ€™s self-knowledge tends to enhance with increasing model size...

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experimental results comparing model sizes and self-knowledge levels
  Strength: Moderate
  Location: Section 4, Analysis
  Limitations: Correlational analysis, not causal

Confidence Level: Medium
Justification: The experimental results support the claim, showing a positive correlation between model size and self-knowledge.
Key Limitations: Correlational analysis, potential confounding variables

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: Performance
Statement: There is a significant gap between the self-knowledge of current LLMs and human proficiency.
Location: Section 4, Compared with Human
Exact Quote: Figure 3 reveals that, without supplementary samples, GPT-4 currently performs best among the tested models...

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Comparison of F1 scores between GPT-4 and human benchmarks
  Strength: Strong
  Location: Section 4, Compared with Human
  Limitations: Limited to the specific models and benchmarks used
  Exact Quote: Figure 3: Comparison between the davinci series and human self-knowledge in instruction input form.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: High
Confidence Level: High
Justification: The comparison provides strong evidence for the claim, highlighting the gap between LLM and human self-knowledge.
Key Limitations: Limited generalizability to other models and benchmarks
