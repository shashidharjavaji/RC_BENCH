Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: The proposed HTML model achieves the highest prediction performance (lowest MSE values) for each of the target time-periods.
Location: Section 6, Table 2
Exact Quote: The HTML model achieves the highest prediction performance (lowest MSE values) for each of the target time-periods.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: MSE values for HTML model: n=3 (1.175), n=7 (0.372), n=15 (0.153), n=30 (0.133)
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6, Table 2
  Limitations: Comparison is based on a specific dataset and evaluation metric (MSE)
  Exact Quote: Table 2: The average n-day volatility prediction errors for our approach (HTML) and the various baselines...

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes

Claim 2:
Type: contribution
Statement: The utility of audio data, and vocal features, in this important financial prediction task, suggests there exists a significant opportunity to explore the use of audio features in a range of related or complementary tasks.
Location: Section 7, Conclusions
Exact Quote: The utility of audio data, and vocal features, in this important financial prediction task, suggests there exists a significant opportunity to explore the use of audio features in a range of related or complementary tasks.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Previous research [46] has demonstrated the benefits of combining text with audio data, compared to text-only features, in volatility prediction.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6.2, On the Utility of Audio Features
  Limitations: Based on a single study and a specific task
  Exact Quote: Previous research [46] has demonstrated the benefits of combining text with audio data, compared to text-only features, in volatility prediction.

- Evidence Text: HTML delivers its most accurate short-term predictions using text+audio, but its most accurate long-term predictions come from the text-only version.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6.2, On the Utility of Audio Features
  Limitations: Based on a single experiment and a specific dataset
  Exact Quote: HTML delivers its most accurate short-term predictions using text+audio, but its most accurate long-term predictions come from the text-only version.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence suggests that audio features have utility in this task, particularly for short-term predictions, but the conclusion is based on limited evidence.
Key Limitations: Limited evidence from a single study and experiment

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: methodology
Statement: The multi-task approach tends to offer improved performance compared to the single-task approach, especially for long-term prediction tasks.
Location: Section 6.4, Single-Task vs Multi-Task Approaches
Exact Quote: The multi-task approach tends to offer improved performance compared to the single-task approach, especially for long-term prediction tasks.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 3: Ablation studies on the multi-task learning and embeddings
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6.4, Single-Task vs Multi-Task Approaches
  Limitations: Based on a specific experiment and dataset
  Exact Quote: Table 3: Ablation studies on the multi-task learning and embeddings

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence strongly supports the claim, as the multi-task approach consistently outperforms the single-task approach for long-term predictions.
Key Limitations: Experiment and dataset limitations
