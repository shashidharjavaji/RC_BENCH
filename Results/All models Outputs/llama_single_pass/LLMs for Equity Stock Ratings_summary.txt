Claim 1:
Type: contribution/performance
Statement: LLMs can be leveraged to effectively utilize large amounts of multimodal financial data, as showcased by their effectiveness at the stock rating prediction task.
Location: Section 1: Introduction
Exact Quote: Our research shows that LLMs can be leveraged to effectively utilize large amounts of multimodal financial data, as showcased by their effectiveness at the stock rating prediction task.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The study utilizes various data types such as fundamental financial data, market data, and news data from January 2022 to June 2024.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1: Data
  Limitations: Limited to the specified time frame and data sources.
  Exact Quote: Our analysis focuses on US equities, specifically the 500 constituents of the S&P 500 index, using data spanning from January 2022 to the end of June 2024.

- Evidence Text: The study evaluates the performance of LLMs in predicting stock ratings using different data sources and modalities.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3: Evaluation
  Limitations: Evaluation is based on forward returns over fixed periods and the quantiles into which these returns fall.
  Exact Quote: We compute the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) using two types of returns — regular market-relative forward returns and sector-relative forward returns.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim by demonstrating the effectiveness of LLMs in utilizing multimodal financial data for stock rating prediction.
Key Limitations: Limited to the specified time frame and data sources.

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: The benchmark Vanilla LLM model demonstrates stronger performance than traditional analyst evaluations when assessed by forward returns.
Location: Section 5.1: Traditional Analyst vs. Vanilla LLM
Exact Quote: The Vanilla method has a lower MAE of 1.447 compared to the Analyst predictions, which has a Return MAE of 1.570.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The Vanilla method has a lower MAE of 1.447 compared to the Analyst predictions, which has a Return MAE of 1.570.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1: Evaluation Averaged Across 3, 6, and 12 Month Periods for Experiments
  Limitations: Comparison is based on a specific evaluation metric (MAE).
  Exact Quote: The Vanilla method has a lower MAE of 1.447 compared to the Analyst predictions, which has a Return MAE of 1.570.

- Evidence Text: The standard deviation of the Vanilla method is 0.745, higher than the Analyst’s 0.637, suggesting that while the predictions are more consistent, they are less accurate overall.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.1: Traditional Analyst vs. Vanilla LLM
  Limitations: Standard deviation is used as a measure of consistency, but may not fully capture the nuances of prediction accuracy.
  Exact Quote: The standard deviation of the Vanilla method is 0.745, higher than the Analyst’s 0.637, suggesting that while the predictions are more consistent, they are less accurate overall.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim by comparing the performance of the Vanilla LLM model to traditional analyst evaluations using MAE.
Key Limitations: Comparison is based on a specific evaluation metric (MAE) and may not capture all aspects of prediction accuracy.

--------------------------------------------------

Statement: The Fundamentals + Sentiment experiment has the best performance in terms of Return MAE, with a value of 1.417, indicating the most accurate predictions.
Location: Section 5.3: Fundamentals vs. Fundamentals + Sentiment
Exact Quote: The Fundamentals + Sentiment experiment has the best performance in terms of Return MAE, with a value of 1.417, indicating the most accurate predictions.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The Fundamentals + Sentiment experiment has a Return MAE of 1.417, outperforming all other experiments.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1: Evaluation Averaged Across 3, 6, and 12 Month Periods for Experiments
  Limitations: Comparison is based on a specific evaluation metric (MAE).
  Exact Quote: The Fundamentals + Sentiment experiment has a Return MAE of 1.417, outperforming all other experiments.

- Evidence Text: The Fundamentals experiment has a Return MAE of 1.421 and a lower standard deviation of 0.732, indicating more consistent predictions.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.3: Fundamentals vs. Fundamentals + Sentiment
  Limitations: Standard deviation is used as a measure of consistency, but may not fully capture the nuances of prediction accuracy.
  Exact Quote: The Fundamentals experiment has a Return MAE of 1.421 and a lower standard deviation of 0.732, indicating more consistent predictions.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim by comparing the performance of the Fundamentals + Sentiment experiment to other experiments using MAE.
Key Limitations: Comparison is based on a specific evaluation metric (MAE) and may not capture all aspects of prediction accuracy.
