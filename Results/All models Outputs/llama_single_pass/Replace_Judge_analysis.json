**Evidence 1:**\n      - **Evidence Text:** \"Across three distinct judge settings and spanning six different datasets, we find that using a PoLL composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.\"\n      - **Strength:** Strong\n      - **Limitations:** Limited to the specific datasets and judge settings evaluated\n      - **Location:** Section 4 Results\n      - **Exact Quote:** \"Across three distinct judge settings and spanning six different datasets, we find that using a PoLL composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.\"\n    -

**Evidence 1:**\n      - **Evidence Text:** \"GPT-4 is one of the weaker evaluators on the single-hop QA task setup, with a lower Cohen\u2019s \u03ba correlation with human judgements compared to other models and the PoLL.\"\n      - **Strength:** Moderate\n      - **Limitations:** Limited to the single-hop QA task setup\n      - **Location:** Table 1\n      - **Exact Quote:** \"We see that overall, PoLL has the strongest correlation across various tasks, while GPT-4 is one of the weaker evaluators on this particular task setup.\"\n    -

**Limitations:** Based on the cost comparison provided\n      - **Location:** Section 4.5 Cost and Latency\n      - **Exact Quote:** \"At the time of writing, the cost of running our specific instance of PoLL is $1.25/input + $4.25/output, whereas the cost of running GPT-4 Turbo is $10/input + $30/output.\"\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    - **Conclusion Justified:** True\n    - **Robustness:** High\n    - **Justification:** The evidence supports the claim by highlighting the drawbacks of using a single large model as an evaluator, including bias and cost.\n    -
