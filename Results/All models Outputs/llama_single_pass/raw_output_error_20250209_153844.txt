**Title:** Attributed Question Answering: Evaluation and Modeling for Attributed Large Language Models

**Authors:** Bernd Bohnet, Vinh Q. Tran, Pat Verga, et al.

**Research Question:** How to develop attributed large language models (LLMs) that can provide evidence for their generated text, and how to evaluate their performance?

**Methodology:**

1. **Task Definition:** Attributed Question Answering (QA) is defined as a task where the input is a question, and the output is an (answer, attribution) pair, where the attribution is a pointer to a fixed corpus.
2. **Evaluation Metrics:**
	* **Human AIS (Attribution Score):** Gold-standard metric, assessed by human raters, evaluating whether the answer is attributable to the provided attribution.
	* **AutoAIS:** Automatic metric, formulating evaluation as a Natural Language Inference task, correlating well with human AIS at the system level.
	* **Exact Match (EM):** Measures answer string accuracy, but has limitations in evaluating attribution.
3. **System Architectures:**
	* **Retrieve-then-read (RTR):** Performs retrieval of relevant passages, then generates an answer and selects an attribution.
	* **Post-hoc Retrieval:** Generates an answer using an LLM, then retrieves an attribution using the question and answer as a query.
	* **LLM-as-retriever:** Uses an LLM to generate both an answer and a pointer to the attribution corpus.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Best Performing System:** RTR achieves the highest performance, but requires large amounts of explicit supervision.
2. **Correlation between AIS and EM/AutoAIS:**
	* **AIS and EM:** Modest correlation (0.45), highlighting EM's limitations in evaluating attribution.
	* **AIS and AutoAIS:** Strong correlation (0.96) at the system level, making AutoAIS a suitable development metric.
3. **Challenges and Future Directions:**
	* **Post-hoc Attribution:** Remains challenging, but is a viable architecture for future work.
	* **End-to-end Modeling:** Shows promise, but requires further development.
	* **Evaluation Metrics:** AutoAIS has limitations at the instance level, and human rating data can be used to improve automatic evaluation metrics.
