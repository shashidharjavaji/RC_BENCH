    "raw_claims": "To analyze the research paper \"Attributed Question Answering: Evaluation and Modeling for Attributed Large Language Models,\" we need to focus on the key contributions and findings. Here's a structured summary of the paper:\n\n### Key Contributions\n\n1. **Definition of Attributed Question Answering (QA):**\n   - The paper defines Attributed QA as a task where the input to the model is a question, and the output is an (answer, attribution) pair.\n   - The attribution should give supporting evidence for the answer.\n\n2. **Evaluation Framework:**\n   - The paper proposes a reproducible evaluation framework for Attributed QA using human annotations as a gold standard.\n   - It also studies AutoAIS, an automatic metric that formulates evaluation as a Natural Language Inference task.\n\n3. **Benchmarking Architectures:**\n   - The paper benchmarks a broad set of architectures for Attributed QA, including retrieve-then-read, post-hoc retrieval, and LLM-as-retriever models.\n   - It also explores different levels of supervision, such as using the full Natural Questions (NQ) training set or a subset of 64 randomly chosen examples.\n\n4. **Experiments and Results:**\n   - The paper presents experiments with various systems and evaluates their performance using human ratings and AutoAIS.\n   - It highlights the importance of attribution in information-seeking scenarios and discusses the challenges and limitations of current methods.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n1. **Performance of Different Architectures:**\n   - Retrieve-then-read (RTR) models generally perform better than post-hoc retrieval models in terms of AIS and AutoAIS scores.\n   - The best RTR system achieves the highest performance, despite using LLMs with relatively small numbers of parameters.\n\n2. **Impact of Supervision:**\n   - The use of the full NQ training set improves performance, but the impact on AIS is smaller compared to EM.\n   - Using a sparse retrieval method (BM25) can achieve competitive performance with dense retrieval methods.\n\n3. **Correlation between Metrics:**\n   - The correlation between system scores on AIS and EM is modest, while the correlation between AIS and AutoAIS is strong.\n   - The reranked variants using AutoAIS as a system component perform worse on human evaluation compared to the original systems.\n\n4. **Challenges and Limitations:**\n   - The paper highlights the challenges of evaluating QA systems, including the large number of possible answers and the difficulty of curating gold standard labels.\n   - It also discusses the limitations of reference answer corpora and string matching evaluation for future research.\n\n### Future Directions\n\n1. **Modeling:**\n   - The paper suggests exploring post-hoc attribution of LLM-generated answers and end-to-end modeling for Attributed QA.\n   - It also mentions the potential of instruction tuning and chain of thought prompting to improve the quality of LLM-generated answers.\n\n2. **Evaluation:**\n   - The paper recommends using the human rating data collected in the paper to improve automatic evaluation metrics for attribution.\n   - It also suggests expanding the work to include multilingual and multimodal attribution.\n\n3. **Tasks:**\n   - The paper highlights the need to evaluate on different datasets and explore the generalizability of the approach to new settings.\n   - It also mentions the potential of attributing generated text in long-form QA.\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\n1. **Factuality:**\n   - The paper emphasizes the challenge of judging factuality in claims and the importance of attribution for users to inspect sources and make their own judgments.\n\n2. **Accessibility:**\n   - The paper acknowledges the resource-intensive nature of the current approaches and the need for low-resource and end-to-end solutions to meet the diverse challenge of attribution in language modeling.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe paper establishes a research agenda to develop attributed large language models, emphasizing the importance of attribution in information-seeking scenarios. It provides a reproducible evaluation framework and benchmarks various architectures, highlighting the challenges and limitations of current methods. The paper also suggests future directions for improving performance and expanding the scope of the work.\n\n### References\n\nThe paper references a wide range of related work, including studies on question answering tasks, LLMs with attribution, and evaluation metrics for attribution. It also mentions the importance of human ratings and the potential of automatic evaluation metrics.\n\n### Examples\n\nThe paper provides examples of system predictions that AIS reveals as valid but that are scored as incorrect by Exact Match. These examples highlight the importance of considering the context and supporting evidence for claims.\n\n### JSON Structure for Claims\n\nThe paper provides a JSON structure for identifying claims in the text, including the claim text, location, claim type, and exact quote. This structure is useful for extracting and analyzing claims from the text.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper presents a comprehensive study of attributed question answering, highlighting the importance of attribution in information-seeking scenarios. It provides a reproducible evaluation framework and benchmarks various architectures, while also discussing the challenges and limitations of current methods. The paper suggests future directions for improving performance and expanding the scope of the work, emphasizing the importance of human ratings and the potential of automatic evaluation metrics.",
