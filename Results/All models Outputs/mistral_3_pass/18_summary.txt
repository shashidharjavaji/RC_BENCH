Claim 10:
Statement: Reflexion has several advantages compared to more traditional RL approaches like policy or value-based learning: 1) it is lightweight and doesn’t require finetuning the LLM, 2) it allows for more nuanced forms of feedback (e.g. targeted changes in actions), compared to scalar or vector rewards that are challenging to perform accurate credit assignment with, 3) it allows for a more explicit and interpretable form of episodic memory over prior experiences, and 4) it provides more explicit hints for actions in future episodes.
