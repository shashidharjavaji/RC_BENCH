    "raw_claims": "The provided text is a research paper titled \"In-Context Retrieval-Augmented Language Models.\" The paper introduces a new approach to retrieval-augmented language modeling (RALM) called In-Context RALM, which aims to improve the performance of language models by conditioning them on relevant documents from a grounding corpus during generation. The paper also discusses the potential of In-Context RALM to increase the prevalence of LM grounding, particularly in settings where a pretrained LM must be used without modification or even via API access.\n\nThe paper presents a simple alternative to existing RALM approaches, which typically focus on modifying the LM architecture to facilitate the incorporation of external information. In-Context RALM, on the other hand, leaves the LM architecture unchanged and prepends grounding documents to the input without any further training of the LM. The paper demonstrates that In-Context RALM can provide surprisingly large LM gains across model sizes and diverse corpora, and that the document retrieval and ranking mechanism can be specialized to the RALM setting to further boost performance.\n\nThe paper also evaluates the application of off-the-shelf retrievers to the In-Context RALM framework and shows that In-Context RALM led to LM performance gains equivalent to increasing the LM's number of parameters by 2\u20133 across all of the text corpora examined. The paper also investigates methods for adapting document ranking to the LM task, a relatively under-explored RALM degree of freedom, and shows that these methods lead to further gains in the LM task corresponding to an additional size increase of 2 in the LM architecture.\n\nThe paper concludes that In-Context RALM has considerable potential to increase the prevalence of LM grounding, particularly in settings where a pretrained LM must be used without modification or even via API access. The paper also discusses the potential of In-Context RALM to serve as a clean probe for developing document retrieval methods that are specialized for the LM task, and to help drive wider deployment of RALM systems.\n\nThe paper also presents a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of In-Context RALM with off-the-shelf retrievers, and shows that BM25 outperformed off-the-shelf neural retrievers in language modeling. The paper also investigates the effect of varying the retrieval stride and query length, and shows that frequent retrieval improves language modeling performance. The paper also discusses the potential of In-Context RALM to improve the factuality of large LMs, and presents a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of In-Context RALM on open-domain question answering tasks.\n\nThe paper also discusses the potential of In-Context RALM to serve as a clean probe for developing document retrieval methods that are specialized for the LM task, and to help drive wider deployment of RALM systems.
