Claim 4:
Statement: We argue that a universal comprehensive evaluation benchmark should have the following four characteristics: (1) It should cover as much as possible, including both perception and cognition abilities. The former refers to recognizing the specific object, such as its existence, count, position, and color. The latter refers to compositing the perception information and the knowledge in LLM to deduce more complex answers. It is obvious that the former is the premise of the latter. (2) Its data or annotations should not come from existing publicly available datasets as much as possible, avoiding the risk of data leakage. (3) Its instructions should be as concise as possible and in line with human cognition. Although instruction design may have a large impact on the output, all models should be tested under the same unified instructions for fair comparison. A good MLLM should be able to generalize to such concise instructions, which are also very common in everyday life. (4) The responses of MLLMs to the instructions should be intuitive and convenient for quantitative analysis. The open-ended answer of MLLMs poses significant challenges to the quantization. Existing methods tend to use GPT or manual scoring, but there may be problems of inaccuracy and subjectivity.

Claim 6:
Statement: MME covers the examination of perception and cognition abilities. Apart from OCR, the perception includes the recognition of coarse-grained and fine-grained objects. The former identifies the existence, count, position, and color of objects. The latter recognizes movie posters, celebrities, scenes, landmarks, and artworks. The cognition includes commonsense reasoning, numerical calculation, text translation, and code reasoning. The total number of subtasks is up to 14, as shown in Fig. 1.
