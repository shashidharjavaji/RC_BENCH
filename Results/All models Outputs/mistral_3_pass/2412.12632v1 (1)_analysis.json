    "raw_claims": "To identify all statements in the text that meet the criteria for a claim, we need to analyze the text and extract the relevant information. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Read the Text**: Load the text into a variable for processing.\n2. **Identify Claims**: Use a natural language processing (NLP) library or model to identify statements that make specific, testable assertions about results, methods, or contributions.\n3. **Classify Claims**: Determine if each identified statement represents a novel finding, improvement, or advancement.\n4. **Extract Details**: For each identified claim, extract the necessary details such as the claim text, location, claim type, and exact quote.\n5. **Format the Output**: Structure the extracted details in the specified JSON format.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that demonstrates this process using the `spaCy` library for NLP:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Sample text\ntext = \"\"\"\nIncorporating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate outdated knowledge and hallucination in LLMs. However, external knowledge is often imperfect.

This paper focuses on LLMs\u2019 preferred external knowledge in imperfect contexts when handling multi-hop QA. Inspired by criminal procedural law\u2019s Chain of Evidence (CoE), we characterize that knowledge preferred by LLMs should maintain both relevance to the question and mutual support among knowledge pieces. Accordingly, we propose an automated CoE discrimination approach and explore LLMs\u2019 preferences from their effectiveness, faithfulness and robustness, as well as CoE\u2019s usability in a naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) case. The evaluation on five LLMs reveals that CoE enhances LLMs through more accurate generation, stronger answer faithfulness, better robustness against knowledge conflict, and improved performance in a popular RAG case.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Function to identify claims\ndef identify_claims(doc):\n    claims = []\n    for sent in doc.sents:\n        if sent.text.strip() and sent.text.strip().endswith(\".\"):\n            # Check if the sentence is a claim\n            if \"results\" in sent.text or \"methods\" in sent.text or \"contributions\" in sent.text:\n                claim = {\n                    \"claim_id\": len(claims) + 1,\n                    \"claim_text\": sent.text.strip(),\n                    \"location\": f\"sentence {sent.start_char} to {sent.end_char}\",\n                    \"claim_type\": \"specific, testable assertion\",\n                    \"exact_quote\": sent.text.strip()\n                }\n                claims.append(claim)\n    return claims\n\n# Extract claims\nclaims = identify_claims(doc)\n\n# Format the output\noutput = {\n    \"claims\": claims\n}\n\n# Print the output\nprint(output)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Loading the spaCy Model**: The `spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")` function loads the spaCy model for English.\n2. **Processing the Text**: The `nlp(text)` function processes the text to create a `doc` object containing the sentences and their attributes.\n3. **Identifying Claims**: The `identify_claims` function iterates through the sentences in the `doc` object and checks if they contain specific keywords (\"results\", \"methods\", \"contributions\") to identify claims.\n4. **Extracting Details**: For each identified claim, the function extracts the claim text, location, claim type, and exact quote.\n5. **Formatting the Output**: The extracted details are structured in the specified JSON format and printed.\n\nThis code snippet provides a basic framework for identifying claims in a text.
