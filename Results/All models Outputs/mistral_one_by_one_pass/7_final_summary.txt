Claim 2:
Statement: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Model pre-training (REALM) by fine-tuning on the challenging task of Open-domain Question Answering (Open-QA).
Location: Abstract

Claim 3:
Statement: The authors compare against state-of-the-art models for both explicit and implicit knowledge storage on three popular Open-QA benchmarks, and find that they outperform all previous methods by a significant margin (4-16% absolute accuracy), while also providing qualitative benefits such as interpretability and modularity.
