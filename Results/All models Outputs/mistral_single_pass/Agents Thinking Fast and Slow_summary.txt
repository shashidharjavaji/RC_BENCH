Claim 1:
Type: contribution
Statement: The dual-system Talker-Reasoner architecture enables agents to converse, reason, and plan.
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: In the context of enabling agents to converse, reason and plan, in this work we consider a dual-system approach that enables those abilities through the two modes of thinking.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The dual-system approach divides the agent into two agents: a fast and intuitive Talker agent and a slower and deliberative Reasoner agent.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Abstract
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We therefore divide the agent into two agents: a fast and intuitive Talker agent and a slower and deliberative Reasoner agent.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is directly stated in the abstract and supported by the division of the agent into two distinct components.
Key Limitations: None

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: The Talker agent is fast and intuitive, while the Reasoner agent is slower and more deliberative.
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: The Talker agent focuses on generating natural and coherent conversation with the user and interacts with the environment, while the Reasoner agent focuses on performing multi-step planning, reasoning, and forming beliefs, grounded in the environment information provided by the Talker.

Type: methodology
Statement: The Talker agent can access memory and prime its responses.
Location: Section 3.2.1
Exact Quote: The Talker agent interacts with memory mem to prime its responses with relevant information xmem, including the latest beliefs that have been formed by the Reasoner and stored in mem.

Evidence:

Claim 6:
Type: contribution
Statement: The Talker-Reasoner architecture is grounded in a real-world scenario of sleep coaching.
Location: Section 4.1
Exact Quote: We use this real-world scenario to ground the evaluation of our dual-agent architecture. We chose AI coaching because it requires having a model of the user being coached, using sleep coaching expert knowledge to ensure scientifically-supported advice, providing a multi-step coaching plan for the user, and being conversational and empathetic much as a human coach would be.
