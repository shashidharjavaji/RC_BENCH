Claim 1:
Statement: Large language models generate complex, open-ended outputs and we aim to identify qualitative categories of erroneous behavior.
Location: Abstract
Type: Research Objective
Quote: Large language models generate complex, open-ended outputs: instead of outputting a class label they write summaries, generate dialogue, or produce working code. In order to asses the reliability of these open-ended generation systems, we aim to identify qualitative categories of erroneous behavior, beyond identifying individual errors.

Evidence:
- Large language models generate complex, open-ended outputs: instead of outputting a class label they write summaries, generate dialogue, or produce working code.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction

Statement: Cognitive biases can be used to hypothesize and test for problems in large language models.
