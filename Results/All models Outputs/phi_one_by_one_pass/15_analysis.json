In Table 1, we show example decoding paths across math (GSM8K, Cobbe et al. (2021a)) and commonsense reasoning (year parity, Allen-Zhu and Li (2023)). We employ the pre-trained PaLM-2 large model (Anil et al., 2023) to compare its greedy decoding path (\ud835\udc58 = 0), predominantly used in state-of-the-art LLMs for reasoning tasks, with alternative decoding paths (\ud835\udc58> 0), where \ud835\udc58 represents the choice of the \ud835\udc58-th token at the first decoding step. This investigation reveals that LLMs indeed can reason by simple decoding changes, without the use of prompting. Furthermore, our study reveals that the presence of a CoT in the decoding path correlates with a higher confidence in the model\u2019s decoded answer."
