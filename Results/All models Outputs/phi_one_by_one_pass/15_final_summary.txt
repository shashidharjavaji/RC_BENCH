Claim 1:
Statement: Pre-trained LLMs can inherently reason without prompting by simply altering the decoding process.
Location: Introduction

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Pre-trained LLMs are capable of inherent reasoning without prompting by simply altering the decoding process.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.1, Section 3.1, Section 3.2
  Limitations: The study primarily focuses on mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks, and the findings may not generalize to all types of reasoning tasks.
  Exact Quote: We investigate whether pre-trained language models inherently possess reasoning capabilities, without explicit prompts. In Table 1, we show example decoding paths across math (GSM8K, Cobbe et al. (2021a)) and commonsense reasoning (year parity, Allen-Zhu and Li (2023)). We employ the pre-trained PaLM-2 large model (Anil et al., 2023) to compare its greedy decoding path (ùëò = 0), predominantly used in state-of-the-art LLMs for reasoning tasks, with alternative decoding paths (ùëò> 0), where ùëò represents the choice of the ùëò-th token at the first decoding step. This investigation reveals that LLMs indeed can reason by simple decoding changes, without the use of prompting. Furthermore, our study reveals that the presence of a CoT in the decoding path correlates with a higher confidence in the model‚Äôs decoded answer.

- Evidence Text: CoT-decoding is the only decoding strategy that effectively elicits reasoning from language models, as shown in Table 4.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.1, Section 3.2
  Limitations: The effectiveness of CoT-decoding may vary depending on the task and model scale.
  Exact Quote: In Table 4, we present results from popular decoding baselines on the Mistral-7B pre-trained model, including temperature sampling (Ackley et al., 1985; Ficler and Goldberg, 2017), top-ùëò sampling (Fan et al., 2018; Holtzman et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019), nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020), and beam search. We can see that CoT-decoding is the only decoding strategy that effectively enables language models to reason, while some of the decoding methods even hurt model reasoning compared to greedy decoding.

- Evidence Text: CoT-decoding effectively elicits reasoning across language models, as shown in Figure 3.
  Strength: strong

  Limitations: The study primarily focuses on mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks, and the findings may not generalize to all types of reasoning tasks.

- Evidence Text: CoT-decoding enables a pre-trained model to achieve a similar performance of an instruction-tuned model, as shown in Figure 4 (left).
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3.2
  Limitations: The effectiveness of CoT-decoding may vary depending on the task and model scale.
  Exact Quote: In Figure 4 (left), CoT-decoding achieves 63.2% accuracy on the pre-trained PaLM-2 Large model, close to the performance of the instruction-tuned model of the same scale at 67.8%.

  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is supported by empirical data from multiple experiments across different models and tasks. The consistent improvement in reasoning performance with CoT-decoding suggests a strong link between the decoding process and the elicitation of reasoning capabilities.

  Limitations: The evidence is based on the results presented in the paper, which may not generalize to all scenarios or models.
  Exact Quote: CoT-decoding combined with CoT-prompting yields even larger reasoning gains over multiple language models.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that combining CoT-decoding with CoT-prompting can lead to further improvements in reasoning performance beyond what is achieved by either method alone. They present evidence showing that CoT-decoding maintains strong performance when compared to self-consistency methods that use CoT-prompts and that when combined with zero-shot CoT-prompting, it yields even larger gains in reasoning performance across multiple language models.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on systematic experiments across various language models and reasoning tasks, showing consistent improvements in performance metrics.
  Limitations: The study may be limited by the specific models and tasks tested, and the generalizability of the findings to other models or more complex reasoning tasks is not fully explored.

Claim 12:
Statement: CoT-decoding maintains strong performance compared to self-consistency when combined with CoT-prompts.
Location: Section 3.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: CoT-decoding maintains strong performance compared to self-consistency when combined with CoT-prompts.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 7
  Limitations: None mentioned in the provided text
  Exact Quote: CoT-decoding (max path) + zero-shot CoT-prompt 40.2% vs. Self-consistency with zero-shot CoT-prompt 39.4% on GSM8K accuracy.

- Evidence Text: CoT-decoding (agg path) + zero-shot CoT-prompt 48.4% vs. Self-consistency with zero-shot CoT-prompt 39.4% on GSM8K accuracy.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 7
  Limitations: None mentioned in the provided text
  Exact Quote: CoT-decoding (agg path) + zero-shot CoT-prompt **48.4%** vs. Self-consistency with zero-shot CoT-prompt 39.4% on GSM8K accuracy.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The evidence supports the claim that CoT-decoding maintains strong performance compared to self-consistency when combined with CoT-prompts, as demonstrated by the higher accuracy achieved by CoT-decoding (agg path) + zero-shot CoT-prompt over self-consistency with zero-shot CoT-prompt on the GSM8K accuracy task.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a direct comparison of the two methods on a standardized benchmark (GSM8K), which is a widely recognized dataset for evaluating mathematical reasoning in language models.
  Limitations: The evidence is limited to the GSM8K dataset and may not generalize to other reasoning tasks or datasets. Additionally, the comparison is based on a single metric (accuracy) and does not consider other factors such as computational efficiency or the quality of the generated reasoning paths.

Claim 13:
Statement: Path aggregation algorithm in CoT-decoding identifies the correct answer more reliably.
Location: Appendix A

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The path aggregation algorithm in CoT-decoding identifies the correct answer more reliably by taking the answer that maximizes Œî[Àú]ùëé = _ùëò_ [Œî][ùëò,ùëé] where Œîùëò,ùëé is the ùëò-th decoding path whose answer = ùëé.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: The accuracy number here is computed over the GSM8K test set, which may not generalize to other datasets or tasks.
  Exact Quote: We propose a weighted aggregation method, i.e., we take the answer that maximizes Œî[Àú]ùëé = _ùëò_ [Œî][ùëò,ùëé] where Œîùëò,ùëé is the ùëò-th decoding path whose answer = ùëé.

- Evidence Text: For the year parity task, CoT-decoding achieves almost perfect accuracy at larger model scales.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: This observation is specific to the year parity task and may not generalize to other tasks.
  Exact Quote: In Figure 4 (left), CoT-decoding achieves 63.2% accuracy on the pre-trained PaLM-2 Large model, close to the performance of the instruction-tuned model at 67.8%.

- Evidence Text: The model tends to perform calculations from left to right in the CoT-decoding paths, rather than following the correct mathematical order.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: This observation points to a potential area for improvement in the model's reasoning capabilities.
  Exact Quote: On Multi-step Arithmetic, we observe that the model tends to perform calculations from left to right in the CoT-decoding paths, rather than following the correct mathematical order.

- Evidence Text: The correct CoT paths become harder to find when the task becomes more synthetic.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: This observation suggests that the effectiveness of CoT-decoding may vary depending on the task complexity.
  Exact Quote: We observe that over these synthetic tasks, we found that existing CoT prompts on Big-Bench-Hard play a larger 'teaching' role in guiding the model to solve such tasks, and in most cases the model just mimics the patterns in the CoT prompts to generate the correct response.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The path aggregation algorithm in CoT-decoding is more reliable in identifying the correct answer because it selects the answer with the highest Œî value, which indicates a higher confidence level in the model's reasoning.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from experiments on various reasoning tasks, including math and commonsense reasoning. The consistent improvement in accuracy when using the path aggregation algorithm supports the claim.
  Limitations: The evidence is limited to specific reasoning tasks and model families. The performance of the path aggregation algorithm may vary for other tasks or models not covered in the study.
