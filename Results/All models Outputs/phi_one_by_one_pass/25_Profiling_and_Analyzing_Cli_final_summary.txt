  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.4.2.4
  Limitations: The method may not fully capture the complexity of the information due to the large volume of the reports.
  Exact Quote: Our analysis shows that WGII has a higher proportion of high and very-high confidence statements, and 33.98% of statements appear in different summary content rather than chapter content.

- Evidence Text: The authors' methodology includes linking related statements across summary sections and chapter content, identifying supporting references, and comparing them with large language models for statement summarization.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3.4.2.4
  Limitations: The method may not fully capture the complexity of the information due to the large volume of the reports.
