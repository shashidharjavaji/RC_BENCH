about the effectiveness of GopherCite's abstention strategy in improving performance. The evidence should be directly related to the claim that abstaining from answering a third of the questions for which GopherCite is most unsure leads to improved performance metrics. Ensure that the extracted evidence includes the specific performance percentages mentioned in the paper and the context in which these improvements are discussed.\n",
