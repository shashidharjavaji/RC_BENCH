Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: Closed-source LLMs generally outperform open-source LLMs on AAAR-1.0.
Location: Results
Exact Quote: Closed-source LLMs generally outperform open-source LLMs on AAAR-1.0, likely due to their richer scientific knowledge stemming from a larger model size.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The paper presents a table showing the performance of various LLMs on the AAAR-1.0 benchmark.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results
  Limitations: The claim is based on a single benchmark and may not generalize to other tasks or datasets.

Claim 6:
Type: methodology
Statement: Multi-modal input (figures and tables) does not significantly improve the performance of LLMs in the EXPDESIGN and WEAKNESS tasks.
Location: Results
Exact Quote: Overall, image information, including both figures and tables, doesn’t bring significant performance improvement, i.e., only InternVL2 gains a performance boost after incorporating figures; while tables slightly drop both models’ results.
