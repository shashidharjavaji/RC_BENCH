Claim 2:
Type: methodology/result
Statement: REALM's retriever and encoder both benefit from REALM pre-training.
Location: Section 4.5
Exact Quote: We first aim to determine whether REALM pre-training improves the retriever or the encoder, or both.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Resetting both the retriever and encoder reduces the system to our main baseline, ORQA.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.5
  Limitations: The evidence does not directly show the individual contributions of the retriever and encoder.
  Exact Quote: Resetting both the retriever and encoder reduces the system to our main baseline, ORQA.

- Evidence Text: Both the encoder and retriever benefit from REALM training separately, but the best result requires both components acting in unison.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.5
  Limitations: The evidence does not directly show the individual contributions of the retriever and encoder.
  Exact Quote: Both the encoder and retriever benefit from REALM training separately, but the best result requires both components acting in unison.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence suggests that both the retriever and encoder benefit from REALM pre-training, and the best performance is achieved when both components are used together.

Claim 3:
Type: methodology/result
Statement: Salient span masking is crucial for REALM.
Location: Section 4.5
Exact Quote: The latter metric more significantly isolates the contribution of improving the retriever during pre-training.

Evidence:

  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.5
  Limitations: The evidence does not directly show the impact of salient span masking on other masking schemes.
  Exact Quote: We compare our salient span masking scheme with (1) random token masking introduced in BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and (2) random span masking proposed by SpanBERT (Joshi et al., 2019).

- Evidence Text: Intuitively, the latent variable learning relies heavily on the utility of retrieval and is therefore more sensitive to a consistent learning signal.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.5
  Limitations: The evidence is based on intuition rather than direct comparison.
  Exact Quote: Intuitively, the latent variable learning relies heavily on the utility of retrieval and is therefore more sensitive to a consistent learning signal.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence suggests that salient span masking is important for REALM, but the evidence is based on intuition rather than direct comparison.
Key Limitations: The evidence is based on intuition rather than direct comparison.

Claim 4:
Type: methodology/result
Statement: Frequent index refreshes during pre-training are important for REALM.
Location: Section 4.5
Exact Quote: The results in Table 2 suggests that a stale index can hurt model training, and further reducing this staleness could offer better optimization.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We run a parallel process to re-embed corpus documents and rebuild the MIPS index.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.5
  Limitations: The evidence does not directly show the impact of index refresh rate on other aspects of the model.
