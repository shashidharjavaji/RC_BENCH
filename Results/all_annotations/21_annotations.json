        "evidence_text": "Inspired by Hao et al. (2021), we propose a knowledge attribution method based on integrated gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017). Our method can evaluate the contribution of each neuron to knowledge predictions. In this paper, we examine FFN intermediate neurons for the masked token, where the answer is predicted.",
        "justification_conclusion": "The knowledge is identified by the integrated gradients method. The focus is on the FFN intermediate neurons as the previous work suggested."

        "evidence_text": "we manipulate its knowledge neurons in two ways: (1) suppressing knowledge neurons by setting their activations to 0; (2) amplifying knowledge neurons by doubling their activations. Then, for each relation, we plot the average change ratio of the probability for the correct answer, corresponding to the manipulation.; Figure 4 shows that suppressing knowledge neurons identified by our knowledge attribution method leads to a consistent decrease (29.03% on average) in the correct probability.; As shown in Figure 5, we have similar observations for amplifying the knowledge neurons identified by our knowledge attribution. We see a consistent increase (31.17% on average) in the correct probability. By contrast, the baseline even decreases the average correct probability by 1.27%.",
        "justification_conclusion": "Amplifying the suppressing the activation of knowledge neurons changes the probability of the correct answer correspondingly."

        "evidence_text": "As shown in Table 4, for our method, the identified knowledge neurons are more significantly activated by knowledge-expressing prompts (T1 = 0.485), compared with the control groups (T2 = 0.019 and T3 = âˆ’0.018). By contrast, for the baseline, the activation of identified neurons cannot distinguish three types of prompts. In addition, since our comparison is based on the webcrawled BINGREL dataset, we validate the generalization of knowledge neurons to open-domain texts that are unseen in PARAREL.",
