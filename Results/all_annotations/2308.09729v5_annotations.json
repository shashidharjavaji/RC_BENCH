        "Claim_text": "The proposed MindMap framework enables LLMs to construct and reason over a graph of thoughts by comprehending and integrating both implicit knowledge from the model and explicit knowledge from knowledge graphs.",
         "Claim_text": "This suggests previous retrieval-based approaches might overly rely on retrieved external knowledge, compromising the language model's (LLM) ability to grasp intricate logic and dialogue nuances using its implicit knowledge. Conversely, MindMap leverages both external and implicit knowledge in graph reasoning, yielding more accurate answers.",
    "Justification_Conclusion": "True. The authors use experiment results as empirical support for this claim and explain it in detailed analysis. This is one perspective of novelty."

        "Claim_id": 2,
        "Claim_text": "MindMap allows LLMs to produce evidence-grounded outputs by consolidating retrieved facts from KGs with the model's implicit knowledge and discovering new patterns within the input KGs.",
        "Evidence_text": "For medical questions, comprehensive domain knowledge is crucial, not well-captured by BERTScore. GPT-4 ranking scores and hallucination quantification reveal that MindMap significantly outperforms others, with an average GPT-4 ranking of 1.8725 and low hallucination scores. This underscores MindMap's ability to generate evidence-grounded, plausible, and accurate answers compared to baseline models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, which may produce incorrect responses due to reliance on implicit knowledge.",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "True. The authors use experiment results as empirical support for this claim and explain it in detailed analysis. This is the other perspective of novelty."

        "Claim_text": "Through experiments on three datasets, MindMap has shown significant improvements in reasoning capabilities over standard prompting techniques and retrieval-augmented methods, proving to be more effective and robust.",
        "Evidence_text": "We evaluate the utilization of external knowledge graphs by MindMap in complex question answering tasks across three medical Q&A datasets: GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, and ExplainCPE. These datasets cover patient-doctor dialogues, multi-round clinical dialogues, and multiple-choice questions from the Chinese National Licensed Pharmacist Examination, respectively.",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "True. The authors present experiment results on these three datasets as empirical support for this claim and explain it in detailed analysis."

        "Claim_text": "The study introduces KG prompting as a method for LLMs to handle graphical inputs effectively and perform synergistic inference, potentially advancing LLMs toward more reliable and applications in production environments.",
        "Evidence_text": "By integrating both implicit and explicit knowledge, LLMs can achieve transparent and dependable inference, adapting to different levels of correctness in additional KG information.",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "False. The authors do not provide sufficient explanation other than plot as show case as support."
