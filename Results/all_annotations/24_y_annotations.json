        "evidence_text": "As a high-level observation, in both the uni- and multilingual cases, relatively more info features are selected, and relatively fewer LM features. Of the LM features that are selected, those which relate to the maximum perplexity or minimum probability appear to be more useful. These features capture locally anomalous speech patterns, relative to either the AD or control language models.",

        "evidence_text": "When training entirely on English data and testing on French, the results using info and info+LM features are significantly improved over the unilingual baseline, while the LM results are reduced, once again indicating that the info features transfer better across languages. The results are very similar to those using the ALL technique for domain adaptation, suggesting that in that case, model training is dominated by the English data.",
