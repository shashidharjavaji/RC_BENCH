        "evidence_text": "When only the captioner or the filter is applied to the dataset with 14M images, performance improvement can be observed. When applied together, their effects compliment each other, leading to substantial improvements compared to using the original noisy web texts.",
        "justification_conclusion": " True. The claim is supported by the evidence. The evidence records the performance of the captioner and the filter when applied to the dataset with 14M images. The results show that the captioner and the filter work together to achieve substantial performance improvement on various downstream tasks by bootstrapping the captions."

        "evidence_text": "As shown in Table 5, BLIP achieves substantial performance improvement compared with existing methods. Using the same 14M pre-training images, BLIP outperforms the previous best model ALBEF by +2.7% in average recall@1 on COCO. As shown in Table 7, BLIP with 14M pretraining images substantially outperforms methods using a similar amount of pre-training data.As shown in Table 7, BLIP with 14M pretraining images substantially outperforms methods using a similar amount of pre-training data. The results are shown in Table 8. Using 14M images, BLIP outperforms ALBEF by +1.64% on the test set. Using 129M images, BLIP achieves better performance than SimVLM which uses 13Ã— more pre-training data and a larger vision backbone with an additional convolution stage. s shown in Figure 5(b), for each transformer block in the image-grounded text encoder, there exist two cross-attention layers to process the two input images, and their outputs are merged and fed to the FFN.",
        "justification_conclusion": "True. The claim is supported by the evidence. The evidence records the performance of BLIP on a wide range of vision-language tasks. The results show that BLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on image-text retrieval, image captioning, visual question answering, visual reasoning, and visual dialog."

        "evidence_text": "Our image-language model has strong generalization ability to video-language tasks. In Table 10 and Table 11, we perform zero-shot transfer to text-to-video retrieval and video question answering, where we directly evaluate the models trained on COCO-retrieval and VQA, respectively. To process video input, we uniformly sample n frames per video (n = 8 for retrieval and n = 16 for QA), and concatenate the frame features into a single sequence. Note that this simple approach ignores all temporal information.",
        "justification_conclusion": "True.  The claim is supported by the evidence. The results show that the image-language model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance when directly transferring to text-to-video retrieval and videoQA."
