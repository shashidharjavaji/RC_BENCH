        "claim_text": "The audio and text features are combined in the information fusion layer to provide input features for the multi-task learner.",
        "evidence_text": "In this paper we propose a hierarchical, multi-task learning approach consisting of two financial forecasting tasks. The primary task involves predicting asset volatility over a given time period (number of days), while our secondary task involves predicting asset volatility for a single day. Our intuition is that this multi-task learning framework will improve prediction performance by reducing the representation bias of our model, and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a hierarchical, multi-task transformer has been used for volatility prediction.",
        "justification_conclusion": "Natural. The picture and text of the article illustrate this conclusion. However, there is no direct sentence to indicate this."

        "claim_text": "a key novelty of the present work stems from the way in which textual and audio features are integrated for multi-task learning, which, as we shall see later, leads to significant prediction benefits.",
        "evidence_text": "It should be clear that significant prediction benefits accrue to the HTML model. The HTML model achieves the highest prediction performance (lowest MSE values) for each of the target time-periods. In particular, the text-only and text+audio versions of HTML generate predictions with substantially lower errors compared to the corresponding versions of the current state-of-the-art, MDRM alternative. These error improvements relative to MDRM are substantial significant, varying with the time-period as follows: 3-days (+38.4%), 7-days (+16.9%), 15-days (+49.0%), and 30-days(+38.7%). Improvements of this scale, relative to the state-of-the-art, are likely to translate into substantial practical benefits and suggest that this new HTML approach stands as a new performance benchmark for volatility forecasting.",
        "justification_conclusion": "True. The claim is supported by the evidence. The results show that the HTML model achieves the highest prediction performance for each of the target time-periods. The text-only and text+audio versions of HTML generate predictions with substantially lower errors compared to the corresponding versions of the current state-of-the-art, MDRM alternative."
