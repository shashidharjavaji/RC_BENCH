        "Claim_text": "Our approach is comprised of a \"Talker\" agent (System 1) that is fast and intuitive, and tasked with synthesizing the conversational response; and a \"Reasoner\" agent (System 2) that is slower, more deliberative, and more logical, and is tasked with multi-step reasoning and planning, calling tools, performing actions in the world, and thereby producing the new agent state.",
        "Evidence_text": "The well-known behavioral science theory proposes that two different systems drive those abilities: the fast and intuitive System 1 and the slow and deliberative System 2[14]. Daniel Kahneman, who introduced the theory, described the two systems for the two modes of thinking as follows: \"System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. It represents the conscious reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do.",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "True. The author uses the literature reference from human behavioral studies to support the rationality of such agent framework design. Later, they also provide some qualitative results to further demonstrate the usefulness of their design."

        "Claim_id": 2,
        "Claim_text": "We discuss success cases of this division of labor, including fast and intuitive conversations driven by the Talker and complex plans and belief states developed by the Reasoner.",
        "Evidence_text": "Case in Section 4.3.2 and The asynchronous approach can be effective for tasks where the Talker is sufficient even if it operates with an older belief state. These are typically System 1 tasks. For example, when the coaching phase is \"understanding\", the Talker can successfully carry out the conversation without the need for the Reasoner to finish the belief updating. However, the Reasoner must update its belief state before the Talker proceeds in complex problem-solving scenarios e.g., when the user is asking for an explicit multistep plan or for specific resources that require tool calling. In those cases, without waiting for the Reasoner to finish, the Talker makes snap judgements. We can see some examples of such \"snap judgement Talker\" behavior when the belief extracted by the Reasoner does not yet capture the correct coaching phase, and does not fetch resources.",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "False. In the authors' discussion, only some of the system's functions performed as expected. The 'Reasoner' agent requires further guidance to fulfill its intended functions."

        "Claim_text": "We also discuss cases where, similar to the dual-system thought machinery, the Reasoner (System 2) might need to override the Talker (System 1).",
        "Evidence_text": "To address this, when the Talker reads that the coaching phase is \"planning\", it is instructed to wait for the Reasoner to finish. This corresponds to System 2 taking over and overruling the impulses of System 1.",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "True. The authors clearly state they conducted the override as well as how and when they conducted it in their discussion."
