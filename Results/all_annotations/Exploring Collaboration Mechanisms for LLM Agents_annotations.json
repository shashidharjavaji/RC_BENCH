        "Claim_text": "Our observations underscore a fascinating parallel: LLM agents mirror certain social behaviors typical of human collaboration. It could further emphasize the potential of human-AI interaction. Generally, fostering effective and efficient collaborative strategies for multi-agent systems could be the key to more socially-aware AI.",
        "Evidence_text": "To address RQ3, we embark on further analysis from a social psychology view (Tajfel, 1982; Tajfel and Turner, 2004; Johnson and Johnson, 2009), to discern alignment between machine society collaboration and human societal dynamics (Woolley et al., 2010). Our findings indicate that machine society collaboration echoes specific human societal phenomena or theories, such as conformity (Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004; Allen and Levine, 1969; Coultas and van Leeuwen, 2015) and consensus reaching (Scheff, 1967; Degroot, 1974; Baronchelli, 2018) (more analysis are in Appendix G.1).",
