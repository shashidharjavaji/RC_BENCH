        "Claim_text": "In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent collaboration system designed to enhance decision-making in financial investment research. The system incorporates agent groups with both configurable group sizes and collaboration structures to leverage the strengths of each agent group type. By utilizing a sub-optimal combination strategy, the system dynamically adapts to varying market conditions and investment scenarios, optimizing performance across different tasks.",
        "Evidence_text": "Centered around leadership and communication, we have developed three distinct agent collaboration patterns, which are referred to as vertical structure, horizontal structure and hybrid structure.",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "True. The claim is explicitly explained in Section 3 of the paper by three subsections. One subsection refers to one agent group size."

        "Claim_text": "We focus on three sub-tasks: fundamentals, market sentiment, and risk analysis, by analyzing the 2023 SEC 10-K forms of 30 companies listed on the Dow Jones Index. Our findings reveal significant performance variations based on the configurations of AI agents for different tasks.",
        "Evidence_text": "This study focuses on the effectiveness of different AI agent structures in the context of investment research. Specifically, it examines the 2023 SEC 10-K forms of 30 companies in the Dow Jones Index to assess the performance of AI agents in three primary tasks: fundamentals analysis, market sentiment analysis, and risks analysis. These analyses inform final investment decisions, including whether to buy or sell stocks and setting target prices for one week ahead. Each task is executed by a team of AI agents equipped with large language models. We evaluate three agent sizes: single, dual, and triple. Additionally, we examine three collaboration structures",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "True. The authors not only emphasize this in the task description but also demonstrate it through comparative results in the subsequent experiments section."

        "Claim_text": "Detailed Analysis of Information Flow: We performed an in-depth analysis of the forms of information flow between agents in tasks of varying difficulty, explaining the core differences produced by different collaboration architectures.",
        "Evidence_text": "Our findings suggest that agents with ensemble structures are more suitable for this practical application. This also highlights the importance of designing multi-agent structures tailored to the specific sub-tasks involved in financial decision-making.",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "True. The authors demonstrate it through comparative results and in-depth analysis in the experiments section."
