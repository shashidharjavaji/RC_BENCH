        "claim_text": "We propose an automatic triggering method called hallucination attack, which includes two modes: weak semantic and OoD attacks.",
        "evidence_text": "The weak semantic attack starts with a given semantic prompt. By selectively replacing a few tokens, we construct an adversarial prompt to maintain its semantic consistency while triggering hallucinations. The OoD attack is initialized as non-sense random tokens, aiming to elicit LLMs responding with the same hallucination.",
        "justification_conclusion": "True. This claim highlights the methodology used to systematically induce hallucinations, demonstrating both semantic and nonsensical adversarial triggering techniques."
