        "claim_text": "In this paper, we show that a very simple document reading mechanism can have a large impact, and that substantial gains can also be made by adapting the document selection mechanism to the task of language modeling.",
        "evidence_text": "We now empirically show that despite its simple document reading mechanism, In-Context RALM leads to substantial LM gains across our diverse evaluation suite. We begin in this section by investigating the effectiveness of off-the-shelf retrievers for In-Context RALM; we go on in ยง6 to show that further LM gains can be made by tailoring document ranking functions to the LM task.",
        "justification_conclusion": "True. The whole section 5 and 6 of the paper is dedicated to showing the effectiveness of In-Context RALM and how it can be further improved by adapting the document selection mechanism to the task of language modeling."
