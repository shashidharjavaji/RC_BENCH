        "evidence_text": "The framework of the proposed JMRI is shown in Fig. 2. Given an image and a language expression, we first feed them into a dual-encoder model to extract feature representations of each modality, and then, linearly project the features into a learned multimodal embedding space for imageâ€“text alignment. The resulting joint representations serve as inputs for later fusion. We design a cross-modal interactor to model intramodal and intermodal contexts with the attention mechanism. Finally, the contextual enriched features are leveraged to regress the spatial coordinate of the referred object in the prediction ead.",
        "justification_conclusion": "True. The proposed method section describes the process of using CLIP to extract and align visual and linguistic features, ensuring that the resulting features are in the same semantic space, which is beneficial for the subsequent cross-modal fusion."
