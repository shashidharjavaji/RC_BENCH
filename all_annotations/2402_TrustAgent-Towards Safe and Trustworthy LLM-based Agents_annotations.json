        "Evidence_text": "Figure 3: Memory System. The system is divided into two main components: working memory and long-term memory. The sensory inputs (1) from the environment are captured in the working memory (2), along with relevant information retrieved from the long-term memory (4). The agent then ”thinks” by feeding the working memory into a MLLM (3) along with a prompt to generate responses and action plans. The responses, along with the working memory, are then stored in the experience pool in long-term memory (4). A consolidation process is then triggered to update the goal-oriented hierarchical knowledge graph (5), connecting the current experience with past events. The knowledge graph consists of experience nodes E, goal nodes G, and long-term goal nodes LTG.",
