        "Claim_text": "Our innovation is to describe goals as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas, which define task-success criteria over trajectories. LTL affords the specification of both state-based and temporally extended goals and allows for alternative goal interpretations.",
        "Evidence_text": "In EMBODIED AGENT INTERFACE, goals g, subgoals Ï•, and action sequences a are modeled as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas. This is motivated by two critical desiderata. First, we need an expressive and compact language to describe both state-based and temporally extended goals. Second, we need a unified interface between different LLM-based modules.",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "True. The authors provide details about LTL in the paper."

        "Claim_text": "In EMBODIED AGENT INTERFACE, built on top of our object-centric and LTL-based task specification, we formalize four critical ability modules in LLM-based embodied decision making, as illustrated in Figure 1: Goal Interpretation, Subgoal Decomposition, Action Sequencing, Transition Modeling.",
        "Evidence_text": "Figure 1: EMBODIED AGENT INTERFACE unifies a broad set of tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals and four LLM-based modules for decision-making.",

        "Evidence_text": "The sensitivity analysis conducted on a large language model's predictions for various tasks provides a detailed view of the model's robustness and areas necessitating improvement. This analysis evaluates the impact of replacing specific actions predicted by the model while maintaining other actions as ground truth across five different task categories: non-spatial relations, object affordance, object orientation, object states, and spatial relations.",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "True. The authors provide sufficient experiment results and analysis to support this claim."
