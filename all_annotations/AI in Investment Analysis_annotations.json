        "Claim_text": "Traditional stock rating methods rely heavily on the expertise of financial analysts, and face several challenges such as data overload, inconsistencies in filings, and delayed reactions to market events. Our study addresses these issues by leveraging LLMs to improve the accuracy and consistency of stock ratings.",
        "Evidence_text": "The commonalities among research utilizing LLMs for prediction include using diverse datasets, employing LLMs at multiple stages and enhancing interpretability. The integration of the capabilities highlighted above and advancements in LLMs significantly enhance financial tasks such as stock movement prediction, risk mitigation and quantitative trading.",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "False. There are no obvious comparative outcomes between the capabilities of human and LLMs in this paper."

        "Claim_text": "We build a reproducible framework to quickly and consistently generate ratings evaluated by forward-returns.",
        "Evidence_text": "We use the system prompt to instruct the LLM to adopt the persona of a financial analyst. By defining this role, we provide the LLM with a clear framework for its function.",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "False. The paper does not mention whether the proposed framework is reproducible or provide details on how it can be reproduced."

        "Claim_text": "We evaluate the performance of LLMs in this task to determine which data sources enhance or impede predictive capabilities over various time horizons.",
        "Evidence_text": "Figure 3 shows that both the Fundamentals and Fundamentals + Sentiment experiments consistently perform best across most months, particularly excelling in the 3, 6, and 12-month periods. This stable performance across horizons reinforces the benefits of incorporating fundamental financial data. The Fundamentals + Sentiment experiment outperforms in the 3 and 6-month periods, demonstrating that combining fundamentals and sentiment scores is effective in the short term but may lead to conflicting signals over longer periods, as indicated by the higher MAE in the 18-month period. Both models outperform the Vanilla experiment and Analyst predictions, highlighting the significant impact of financial fundamentals. Including company and sector sentiment, without the actual news summary data, improves prediction accuracy, likely due to decreased complexity and noise from news data.",
        "Justification_Conclusion": "True. The claim is supported by the experiments results and further analysis."
