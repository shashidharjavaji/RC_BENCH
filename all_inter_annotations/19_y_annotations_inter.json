        "evidence_text": "Compared to the prior LLM-based works that support video-only input and audio-visual input, our method consistently brings a +4.4% accuracy on MSRVTT-QA, a +1.9% accuracy on MSVD-QA, and a +2.4% accuracy on ActivityNet-QA. From the significant improvements, we can find that the proposed modality-augmented training mechanism, which jointly optimizes diverse modality samples in the same video can significantly enhance video alignment with LLMs compared to works (e.g., Valley and Video-ChatGPT) that focus on visual-only samples.",

We also show comparable performance on audio tasks (e.g., AudioCaps [35]), demonstrating the substantial potential of our method in audio.",
