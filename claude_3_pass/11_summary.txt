=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: AutoAIS metric correlates strongly with human judgments at the system level, making it suitable for development
Location: Abstract
Type: Results finding
Quote: We take human annotations as a gold standard and show that a correlated automatic metric is suitable for development.

Evidence:
- Correlation between system AIS and AutoAIS scores shows Pearson coefficient of 0.96
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.5
  Limitations: Only demonstrates system-level correlation
  Quote: correlation between system AIS and AutoAIS scores is remarkably strong, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.96 (Figure 3)

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Correlation analysis is only at system level; may not reflect instance-level performance
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: Retrieve-then-read achieves the best performance on Attributed QA but requires significant supervision
Location: Section 5.3
Type: Results finding
Quote: Best RTR achieves the highest performance (p≪10−5, t = 4.55, in comparison with the best non-RTR system), despite using LLMs with relatively small numbers of parameters

Evidence:
- Best RTR achieves highest performance with statistical significance
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.3
  Limitations: Significance only compared to non-RTR systems
  Quote: Best RTR achieves the highest performance (p ≪ 10−5, t = 4.55, in comparison with the best non-RTR system)

- RTR requires large supervision and depends on retrieval accuracy
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.3
  Limitations: Stated as observation without direct experimental evidence
  Quote: RTR approaches have the shortcoming that they require relatively large amounts of explicit supervision, for example in the form of NQ examples

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Exact requirements for 'significant supervision' not quantified; alternatives with less supervision not fully explored
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: AutoAIS has strong system-level correlation with human judgments but weaker instance-level correlation
Location: Section 5.5
Type: Results finding
Quote: On the other hand, correlation between system AIS and AutoAIS scores is remarkably strong, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.96 (Figure 3).

Evidence:
- Instance-level correlation analysis shows lower and more variable correlation
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.5
  Limitations: Specific correlation values not provided
  Quote: Correlation was much lower and more variable here

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Specific correlation values at instance level not provided; degree of variability not quantified
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: EM (Exact Match) correlates only modestly with human judgment of attribution quality
Location: Section 5.3
Type: Results finding
Quote: The most striking result is that the systems which perform best on AIS do not necessarily achieve the strongest EM accuracy

Evidence:
- Pearson correlation between EM and AIS scores is 0.45
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.5
  Limitations: Only system-level correlation examined
  Quote: the Pearson correlation coefficient between the system EM and AIS scores is modest, at 0.45

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Correlation analysis is purely statistical; specific cases where EM fails not fully analyzed
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Dense retrieval outperforms sparse retrieval for both RTR and post-hoc systems
Location: Section 5.4
Type: Results finding
Quote: In the RTR models, the best dense-retrieval system (RTR-10) outperforms the best sparse-retrieval system (RTR-4) by 17 points AIS (p≪10−13, t = 7.79). Among the post-hoc systems, the dense retrievers also have the edge

Evidence:
- Dense retrieval outperforms sparse retrieval in RTR by 17 points AIS
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.4
  Limitations: Limited to specific experimental setup
  Quote: In the RTR models, the best dense-retrieval system (RTR-10) outperforms the best sparse-retrieval system (RTR-4) by 17 points AIS (p ≪ 10−13, t = 7.79)

- Dense retrieval shows statistically significant advantage for post-hoc systems
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.4
  Limitations: Exact performance difference not specified
  Quote: Among the post-hoc systems, the dense retrievers also have the edge with the AIS difference between the best systems of each class (Post-6 vs Post-2) being statistically significant (p ≪ 0.01, t = 2.91)

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Performance gap may vary across different datasets or question types; computational costs not compared
Confidence: high
