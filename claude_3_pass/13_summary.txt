Claim 5:
Statement: DPR generalizes well across datasets even without fine-tuning
Location: Section 5.2
Type: Performance result
Quote: DPR generalizes well, with 3-5 points loss from the best performing fine-tuned model in top-20 retrieval accuracy (69.9/86.3 vs. 75.0/89.1 for WebQuestions and TREC, respectively), while still greatly outperforming the BM25 baseline (55.0/70.9)

Evidence:
- DPR trained only on Natural Questions performs well on other datasets
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.2 Cross-dataset generalization
  Limitations: Only tested on WebQuestions and CuratedTREC
  Quote: DPR generalizes well, with 3-5 points loss from the best performing fine-tuned model in top-20 retrieval accuracy (69.9/86.3 vs. 75.0/89.1 for WebQuestions and TREC, respectively)

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: 3-5 point performance drop compared to fine-tuned models
Confidence: medium

Claim 6:
Statement: DPR processes questions nearly 42 times faster than BM25/Lucene
Location: Section 5.4
Type: Performance result
Quote: DPR can be made incredibly efficient, processing 995.0 questions per second, returning top 100 passages per question. In contrast, BM25/Lucene (implemented in Java, using file index) processes 23.7 questions per second per CPU thread

Evidence:
- DPR processes questions much faster than BM25/Lucene
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.4 Run-time Efficiency
  Limitations: Specific hardware setup may affect results
  Quote: DPR can be made incredibly efficient, processing 995.0 questions per second, returning top 100 passages per question. In contrast, BM25/Lucene (implemented in Java, using file index) processes 23.7 questions per second per CPU thread
