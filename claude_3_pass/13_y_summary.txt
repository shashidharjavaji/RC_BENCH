=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: Original BERT performs poorly in sentence embeddings due to static token embedding bias and ineffective BERT layers rather than anisotropy
Location: Abstract and Introduction
Type: Research finding
Quote: We firstly analyze the drawback of current sentence embedding from original BERT and find that it is mainly due to the static token embedding bias and ineffective BERT layers.

Evidence:
- BERT layers damage quality and anisotropy is not primary cause
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3
  Limitations: Limited to specific BERT variants tested
  Quote: averaging the last layer of original BERT is even worse than averaging its static token embeddings in semantic textual similarity task, but the sentence embeddings from last layer are less anisotropic than static token embeddings

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Analysis focused on specific BERT variants, may not generalize to all architectures
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: PromptBERT achieves 2.29 and 2.58 points improvement over SimCSE on BERT and RoBERTa in unsupervised setting
Location: Abstract
Type: Performance improvement
Quote: Compared to SimCSE, PromptBert achieves 2.29 and 2.58 points of improvement based on BERT and RoBERTa in the unsupervised setting.

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific experimental setup and datasets used
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: Original BERT layers damage the quality of sentence embeddings
Location: Introduction
Type: Research finding
Quote: Following this result, we find original BERT layers actually damage the quality of sentence embeddings.

Evidence:
- BERT layers significantly harm performance on bert-base-uncased and roberta-base
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3 - Observation 1
  Limitations: Only tested on specific model variants
  Quote: Table 1 shows the BERT layers in bert-base-uncased and roberta-base significantly harm the sentence embeddings performance

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited to specific BERT variants tested, mechanism not fully explained
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: Static token embeddings distribution is biased by frequency, case sensitivity and subword tokenization
Location: Introduction
Type: Research finding
Quote: we find the distribution of token embeddings is not only biased by frequency, but also case sensitive and subword in WordPiece

Evidence:
- Token embeddings show clear bias patterns in visualization
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3 - Observation 2
  Limitations: Visual analysis may be subjective
  Quote: The token embeddings can be roughly divided into three regions according to the subword and case biases: 1) the lowercase begin-of-word tokens, 2) the uppercase begin-of-word tokens and 3) the subword tokens

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Visualization is qualitative evidence, would benefit from quantitative analysis
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Template denoising helps reduce the gap between supervised and unsupervised performance
Location: Introduction
Type: Method contribution
Quote: we propose a prompt based contrastive learning method with template denoising to leverage the power of BERT in an unsupervised setting, which significantly shortens the gap between the supervised and unsupervised performance.

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: Insufficient direct evidence provided in excerpts
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: Prompts provide a better way to generate positive pairs through different templates
Location: Introduction
Type: Method contribution
Quote: We find prompts can provide a better way to generate positive pairs by different viewpoints from different templates.

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: Claim made but detailed evidence not provided in excerpts
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 7:
Statement: PromptBERT shows more stable results than SimCSE across random seeds
Location: Discussion
Type: Research finding
Quote: Compared to SimCSE, our method shows more stable results than it.

Evidence:
- Comparison of stability across random seeds
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6.2
  Limitations: Limited to 10 random seeds
  Quote: The difference between the best and worst results can be up to 3.14% in SimCSE. However, the gap in our method is only 0.53

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited to specific comparison with SimCSE, small sample size of random seeds
Confidence: medium
