Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific performance metrics and experimental details provided in Section 3
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: The proposed enhancement methods improve accuracy by up to 17% for domain task and 42% for numeric type task
Location: Abstract
Type: Results
Quote: Extensive experiments on two tasks - the Domain Query Task (which involved testing 500 XBRL term explanations and 50 domain questions) and the Numeric Type Query Task (tested 1, 000 financial math tests and 50 numeric queries) - demonstrate substantial performance improvements, with accuracy increasing by up to 17% for the domain task and 42% for the numeric type task.

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Results clearly shown in experimental data with specific percentage improvements
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: LLMs have limited financial domain knowledge and insufficient mathematical capabilities when analyzing XBRL reports
Location: Section 3.3 Findings
Type: Finding
Quote: Limited financial domain knowledge. The models demonstrate insufficient mastery of specialized financial knowledge and terminology, hindering their ability to provide accurate and granular interpretations of XBRL reports... Deficient mathematical capabilities The LLMs exhibit a notable weakness in processing and interpreting numeric information

Evidence:
- Motivating experiments revealed LLMs' limitations in domain knowledge and math capabilities
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3 Findings
  Limitations: Limited to three specific LLM models tested
  Quote: Our analysis reveals two inherent limitations of LLMs for XBRL report analysis... Limited financial domain knowledge... Deficient mathematical capabilities

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Based on limited set of experiments; may not generalize to all XBRL analysis scenarios
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Implementing a retriever improves performance of all three tested LLMs for domain-related queries
Location: Section 5.2 Results
Type: Result
Quote: Implementing a retriever for domain-related queries improves the performance of all three tested LLMs, as shown in the left two columns of Figure 6.

Evidence:
- Retriever implementation improved performance across all LLMs for XBRL Term task
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.2 Results
  Limitations: Results focused primarily on XBRL Term task
  Quote: For XBRL Term, Qwen2-7B achieves 89% accuracy, followed by Llama3-8B (84%) and Gemma2-9B (83%). These results represent the retriever's effectiveness in enhancing comprehension of XBRL terminology.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Improvements shown with specific metrics, though long-term stability not assessed
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: Integrating a calculator into LLMs improves their performance on numeric type queries
Location: Section 5.2 Results
Type: Result
Quote: Integrating a calculator into LLMs improves their performance on numeric type queries (Fig. 6, right columns).

Evidence:
- Calculator integration improved Financial Math task performance
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.2 Results
  Limitations: Improvements varied significantly between tasks
  Quote: For Financial Math, Llama3-8B achieves an accuracy of 63%, followed by Qwen2-7B (58%) and Gemma2-9B (52%), showing 25-35 percentage point improvements.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Improvements varied significantly between tasks; some showed only modest gains
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 7:
Statement: Combining the retriever and calculator for numeric type query task yields significant improvements
Location: Section 5.2 Results
Type: Result
Quote: Combining the retriever and calculator for numeric type query task yields significant improvements (Figure 7).

Evidence:
- Combined retriever and calculator showed significant improvements in numeric tasks
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.2 Results
  Limitations: Results specific to tested models and tasks
  Quote: Numeric Query to XBRL Reports task exhibits profound improvements: Llama3-8B (53%), Gemma2-9B (49%), and Qwen2-7B (46%), representing increases of 25 to 30 percentage points compared to the single tool approach.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Clear performance improvements shown, though still room for improvement in mathematical calculations
Confidence: high
