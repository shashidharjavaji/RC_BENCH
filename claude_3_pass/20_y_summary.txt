=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: The proposed log probability increase method outperforms seven other methods across three metrics for neuron-level knowledge attribution
Location: Abstract
Type: Method Performance
Quote: Compared to seven other methods, our approach demonstrates superior performance across three metrics.

Evidence:
- Results show the method achieves best performance across MRR, probability and log probability metrics compared to 7 other methods
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1/Results and analysis
  Limitations: Limited to two models (GPT2-large and Llama-7B) and six knowledge types
  Quote: Compared with the other seven methods, our attribution method (second line) attributes more important neurons, resulting in the most significant reduction across all metrics in both GPT2 and Llama.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Limited to two specific models (GPT2-large and Llama-7B), may not generalize to other architectures
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: The authors developed a new method for identifying query neurons that activate value neurons
Location: Abstract
Type: Method Development
Quote: Additionally, since most static methods typically only identify 'value neurons' directly contributing to the final prediction, we propose a method for identifying 'query neurons' which activate these 'value neurons'.

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: No clear evidence presented in the provided text to support this specific claim
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: Both attention and FFN layers can store knowledge, with important neurons located in deep layers
Location: Introduction
Type: Finding
Quote: 1) Both attention and FFN layers can store knowledge, and all important neurons directly contribute to knowledge prediction are in deep layers.

Evidence:
- Analysis of layer importance shows top important layers are in deep layers
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2/Layer-level knowledge storage
  Limitations: Analysis focused on six specific knowledge types
  Quote: Both attention and FFN layers have ability to store knowledge, and all the top10 layers are in deep layers.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Analysis limited to six types of knowledge, may not generalize to other knowledge types
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: Knowledge with similar semantics is stored in the same attention heads while distinct semantic knowledge is stored in different heads
Location: Introduction
Type: Finding
Quote: 2) In attention layers, knowledge with similar semantics (e.g. language, country, city) tends to be stored in the same heads. Knowledge with distinct semantics (e.g. country, color) is stored in different heads.

Evidence:
- Head-level analysis shows semantic clustering
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2/Head-level knowledge storage
  Limitations: Limited to specific semantic categories tested
  Quote: Knowledge with similar semantics is stored in the same heads (e.g. a[6]30 in GPT2 and a[12]23 in Llama)

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited to specific semantic categories, needs broader validation across more knowledge types
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Intervening on a small number of value or query neurons can significantly impact final predictions
Location: Introduction
Type: Finding
Quote: 3) While numerous neurons contribute to the final prediction, intervening on a few value neurons (300) or query neurons (1000) can significantly influence the final prediction.

Evidence:
- Intervening on small number of neurons shows large impact
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2/Neuron-level knowledge storage
  Limitations: Effects measured only on MRR and probability metrics
  Quote: When intervening the top200 attention neurons and top100 FFN neurons for each sentence, the MRR and probability decreases 96.3%/99.2% in GPT2, and 96.9%/99.6% in Llama.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Impact measured on specific metrics only, other effects not analyzed
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: FFN value neurons are mainly activated by medium-deep attention value neurons, which are activated by shallow/medium FFN query neurons
Location: Introduction
Type: Finding
Quote: 4) FFN value neurons are mainly activated by medium-deep attention value neurons, while these attention neurons are mainly activated by shallow/medium FFN query neurons.

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: No clear evidence presented in the text to support this specific claim
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 7:
Statement: The proposed log probability increase method achieves the best performance compared to seven other static methods under three metrics
Location: Experiments
Type: Method Performance
Quote: Compared with the other seven methods, our attribution method (second line) attributes more important neurons, resulting in the most significant reduction across all metrics in both GPT2 and Llama.

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Comparison limited to static methods only, not compared to dynamic methods
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 8:
Statement: The sum importance score of top200 attention neurons and top100 FFN neurons is similar to that of all neurons
Location: Neuron-level knowledge storage
Type: Finding
Quote: The sum importance score of top200 attention neurons and top100 FFN neurons are similar to that of all neurons.

Evidence:
- Top neurons capture similar importance score as all neurons
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2/Neuron-level knowledge storage
  Limitations: Analysis limited to specific models and knowledge types
  Quote: The sum score of top200 neurons in attention layers and top100 neurons in FFN layers are similar to that of all neurons.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited to specific neuron counts, may not hold for different thresholds
Confidence: medium
