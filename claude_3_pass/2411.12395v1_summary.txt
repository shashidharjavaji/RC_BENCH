=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: Simple training-free token-level disambiguation methods can effectively improve LLM performance for ambiguous question answering tasks
Location: Abstract
Type: Main finding
Quote: We demonstrate how simple, training-free, token-level disambiguation methods may be effectively used to improve LLM performance for ambiguous question answering tasks.

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited to specific disambiguation methods tested, may not generalize to all token-level methods
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: Using disambiguating prompts improves performance over naive settings for both GPT 4o and 4o-mini
Location: Results and Discussion
Type: Empirical finding
Quote: Interestingly, we see that for both GPT 4o and 4o-mini, using simple disambiguating prompts improves performance over the naive setting, implying that simple prompt-based, training-free approaches may be useful in improving LLM performance for ambiguous queries.

Evidence:
- Using simple disambiguating prompts improves performance over naive setting as shown by GT Answer Overlap scores
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results and Discussion - RQ1, Tables I and II
  Limitations: Limited to two specific LLM models
  Quote: GT Answer Overlap for GPT-4o: Naive=0.759, What=0.778, Context=0.789; For GPT-4o-mini: Naive=0.692, What=0.707, Context=0.71

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Results specific to GPT models tested, magnitude of improvement varies
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: Disambiguation via adding context performs better than disambiguation via 'what' rephrasing for both LLMs
Location: Results and Discussion
Type: Comparative finding
Quote: Out of the two simple disambiguating methods explored, we see that disambiguation via adding context performs better for both LLMs.

Evidence:
- Context disambiguation shows higher GT Answer Overlap compared to 'what' rephrasing for both models
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Results and Discussion - RQ1, Tables I and II
  Limitations: Difference is small and context method has known issues with irrelevant additions
  Quote: Out of the two simple disambiguating methods explored, we see that disambiguation via adding context performs better for both LLMs.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Context method shows inconsistent performance based on question type
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: Small-scale fine-tuning does not improve LLM performance on ambiguous questions
Location: Results and Discussion
Type: Negative finding
Quote: Therefore, we see that fine-tuning, at least at this small scale, does not provide any improvement in LLM performance on ambiguous questions.

Evidence:
- Fine-tuning experiment shows worse performance compared to base model
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Results and Discussion - RQ2
  Limitations: Only tested on GPT-4o-mini with small sample size of 50 questions
  Quote: The GT Answer Overlap for the 4o-mini model is 0.643 while that for the fine-tuned 4o-mini model is 0.626.

Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: Only tested with 50 examples, potential catastrophic forgetting noted by authors
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Using lower temperature values does not significantly improve LLM performance on ambiguous questions
Location: Results and Discussion
Type: Negative finding
Quote: This implies simply using a lower value of temperature may not provide any benefits in LLM performance for answering ambiguous questions.

Evidence:
- Lower temperature shows minimal improvement in performance
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Results and Discussion - RQ3
  Limitations: Only tested two temperature values
  Quote: we see that although lower temperature (0.2 instead of 1.0, in this case) seem to have minor improvements in some cases, the difference is not that significant

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Only tested temperature values of 0.2 vs 1.0, other values not explored
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: LLMs show better disambiguation performance for questions that human annotators were also able to disambiguate clearly
Location: Results and Discussion
Type: Correlation finding
Quote: This shows that LLMs are able to better understand certain social cues to correctly disambiguate the provided question in cases where the human annotator was able to disambiguate them as well.

Evidence:
- Context enrichment performs better on subset where human disambiguations match ground truth
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results and Discussion - Problem with naive contextual enrichment
  Limitations: Analysis limited to specific subset of data
  Quote: when we took a subset of AmbigQA where the human-provided answer of a human-provided disambiguated question provided matches the ground truth, adding context to those questions increases the accuracy of the model

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Selection bias in subset analysis, correlation vs causation not established
Confidence: medium
