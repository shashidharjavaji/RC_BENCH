Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: A ResNet-like architecture is a strong baseline that was missing in prior works
Location: Abstract
Type: Methods/Contribution
Quote: The first one is a ResNet-like architecture which turns out to be a strong baseline that is often missing in prior works.

Evidence:
- Results show ResNet is superior baseline that competitors cannot consistently outperform
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4
  Limitations: Limited to compared models in study
  Quote: ResNet turns out to be an effective baseline that none of the competitors can consistently outperform.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Claim about 'missing in prior works' requires more thorough literature review evidence; benchmark dataset selection could affect conclusion
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: FT-Transformer performs well on a wider range of tasks than other deep learning models
Location: Introduction
Type: Results/Performance
Quote: Interestingly, FT-Transformer turns out to be a more universal architecture for tabular data: it performs well on a wider range of tasks than the more 'conventional' ResNet and other DL models.

Evidence:
- FT-Transformer maintains competitive performance across all tasks while GBDT and ResNet only perform well on subsets
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.6
  Limitations: Based on observational analysis of results
  Quote: FT-Transformer provides competitive performance on all tasks, while GBDT and ResNet perform well only on some subsets of the tasks.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Qualitative observation that would benefit from more rigorous quantitative analysis of performance variance across tasks
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: The ensemble of default FT-Transformers outperforms GBDT ensembles on most datasets
Location: Analysis/Default hyperparameters
Type: Results/Performance
Quote: Table 4 demonstrates that the ensemble of FT-Transformers mostly outperforms the ensembles of GBDT, which is not the case for only two datasets (California Housing, Adult).

Evidence:
- Default FT-Transformer ensembles outperform GBDT ensembles on all but two datasets
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.5
  Limitations: Only compared against default GBDT configurations
  Quote: Table 4 demonstrates that the ensemble of FT-Transformers mostly outperforms the ensembles of GBDT, which is not the case for only two datasets (California Housing, Adult).

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Limited to specific benchmark datasets; default hyperparameters may not represent optimal GBDT performance
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Feature biases in Feature Tokenizer are essential for FT-Transformer's good performance
Location: Ablation study
Type: Methods/Design
Quote: The results averaged over 15 runs are reported in Table 5 and demonstrate both the superiority of the Transformer's backbone to that of AutoInt and the necessity of feature biases.

Evidence:
- Ablation study shows performance drops when removing feature biases
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.2
  Limitations: Limited details on magnitude of performance difference
  Quote: The results averaged over 15 runs are reported in Table 5 and demonstrate both the superiority of the Transformer's backbone to that of AutoInt and the necessity of feature biases.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Ablation study limited to subset of datasets; mechanism of importance not fully explained
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: Averaging attention maps provides effective feature importance measurement comparable to Integrated Gradients but with much lower computational cost
Location: Obtaining feature importances from attention maps
Type: Methods/Performance
Quote: Given that IG can be orders of magnitude slower and the 'baseline' in the form of PT requires (nfeatures + 1) forward passes (versus one for the proposed method), we conclude that the simple averaging of attention maps can be a good choice in terms of cost-effectiveness.

Evidence:
- Attention map averaging performs similarly to Integrated Gradients but requires only single forward pass
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.3
  Limitations: Similarity does not imply identical feature importances
  Quote: Interestingly, the proposed method yields reasonable feature importances and performs similarly to IG (note that this does not imply similarity to IG's feature importances). Given that IG can be orders of magnitude slower and the 'baseline' in the form of PT requires (nfeatures + 1) forward passes (versus one for the proposed method), we conclude that the simple averaging of attention maps can be a good choice in terms of cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Evaluation limited to rank correlation with permutation test; no analysis of quality of feature importance interpretations
Confidence: medium
