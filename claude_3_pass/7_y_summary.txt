Claim 1:
Statement: The proposed HTML model delivers substantial prediction accuracy improvements of 17% - 49% compared to the current state-of-the-art
Location: Abstract
Type: Performance improvement
Quote: This includes a comprehensive comparison to a variety of baselines, which demonstrates very significant improvements in prediction accuracy, in the range 17% - 49% compared to the current state-of-the-art.

Claim 2:
Statement: Audio and text features from earnings calls can significantly improve volatility prediction compared to traditional price-based methods
Location: Results and Discussion
Type: Finding
Quote: Table 2 shows how both text-based and multimodal approaches consistently outperform methods that are purely based on historical pricing, for both short-term (n = 3) and long-term (n = 30) volatility prediction.

Evidence:
- Text and multimodal approaches outperform price-based methods
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6.1
  Limitations: Specific performance margins not quantified
  Quote: Table 2 shows how both text-based and multimodal approaches consistently outperform methods that are purely based on historical pricing, for both short-term (n = 3) and long-term (n = 30) volatility prediction

Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited comparison set of price-based methods, results may be dataset-specific
Confidence: medium

Claim 3:
Statement: HTML delivers its most accurate short-term predictions using text+audio, but its most accurate long-term predictions come from the text-only version
Location: Results and Discussion
Type: Finding
Quote: HTML delivers its most accurate short-term predictions using text+audio, but its most accurate long-term predictions come from the text-only version.

Evidence:
- HTML performance with text vs text+audio for different time horizons
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6.2
  Limitations: Statistical significance only shown for n=3
  Quote: HTML delivers its most accurate short-term predictions using text+audio, but its most accurate long-term predictions come from the text-only version

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Statistical significance only shown for short-term (n=3), mechanism not fully explained
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: The hierarchical transformer architecture provides stronger performance than attention models on all tasks
Location: Results and Discussion
Type: Performance comparison
Quote: The performance of our model is stronger on all tasks, suggesting improvements due to the progressive architecture of Hierarchical Transformer and the use of pre-trained word embeddings.

Evidence:
- Comparison of hierarchical transformer to HAN attention model
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6.3
  Limitations: Limited comparison details provided
  Quote: The performance of our model is stronger on all tasks, suggesting improvements due to the progressive architecture of Hierarchical Transformer

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited comparison to only HAN model, architecture advantages not fully isolated
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Multi-task approach tends to offer improved performance compared to single-task approach, especially for long-term prediction tasks
Location: Results and Discussion
Type: Finding
Quote: On a like-for-like basis, most of the multi-task variations in Table 3 present that we superior prediction performance when compared to the corresponding single-task variation, especially for long-term prediction tasks.

Evidence:
- Multi-task vs single-task performance comparison
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6.4
  Limitations: Based on qualitative comparison from Table 3
  Quote: most of the multi-task variations in Table 3 present that we superior prediction performance when compared to the corresponding single-task variation, especially for long-term prediction tasks

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Specific benefits for long-term prediction not thoroughly explained or analyzed
