Claim 1:
Statement: Chain-of-thought prompting significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning
Location: Abstract
Type: Main finding
Quote: We explore how generating a chain of thought—a series of intermediate reasoning steps—significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning.

Evidence:
- Chain-of-thought prompting significantly improved performance across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks for large models
  Strength: strong
  Location: Sections 3.2, 4, 5
  Limitations: Improvements mainly shown for very large models (>100B parameters)
  Quote: chain-of-thought prompting outperforms standard prompting, sometimes to a striking degree. Figure 2 illustrates one such result—on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, chain-of-thought prompting with PaLM 540B outperforms standard prompting by a large margin

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: improvements varied across tasks; some tasks showed minimal gains
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: Chain-of-thought reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via simple prompting
Location: Abstract
Type: Key finding
Quote: In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain-of_thought prompting

Evidence:
- Chain-of-thought abilities only emerge at large model scales around 100B parameters
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.2
  Limitations: Exact threshold for emergence not precisely defined
  Quote: chain-of-thought prompting does not positively impact performance for small models, and only yields performance gains when used with models of ~100B parameters

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: exact threshold for emergence not clearly defined; limited model architectures tested
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: PaLM 540B with chain-of-thought prompting achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GSM8K math problems
Location: Abstract
Type: Performance result
Quote: prompting a PaLM 540B with just eight chain-of-thought exemplars achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.

Evidence:
- PaLM 540B with chain-of-thought achieved 58.6% accuracy on GSM8K, surpassing prior SOTA
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: Required external calculator for best performance
  Quote: PaLM 540B [...] Chain of thought 56.9 (+39.0) [...] + ext. calc 58.6

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: relies on external calculator for best performance; single benchmark
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: Chain-of-thought prompting improves performance dramatically on tasks where standard prompting has flat scaling curves
Location: Discussion
Type: Key finding
Quote: For many reasoning tasks where standard prompting has a flat scaling curve, chain-of-thought prompting leads to dramatically increasing scaling curves.

Evidence:
- Chain-of-thought shows dramatic improvements on tasks with flat standard prompting scaling curves
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6
  Limitations: Limited to specific reasoning tasks tested
  Quote: For many reasoning tasks where standard prompting has a flat scaling curve, chain-of-thought prompting leads to dramatically increasing scaling curves

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: correlation between flat scaling and improvement not systematically analyzed
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Chain-of-thought prompting expands the set of tasks that large language models can perform successfully
Location: Discussion
Type: Capability advancement
Quote: Chain-of-thought prompting appears to expand the set of tasks that large language models can perform successfully

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: no explicit evidence provided in excerpt
Confidence: low

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: Chain-of-thought prompting facilitates out-of-domain generalization to longer sequence lengths in symbolic reasoning tasks
Location: Section 5
Type: Capability finding
Quote: Hence, chain-of-thought prompting facilitates length generalization beyond seen chains of thought for language models of sufficient scale.

Evidence:
- Models could generalize to longer sequences than seen in exemplars for symbolic tasks
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: Only tested on two synthetic tasks
  Quote: chain-of-thought prompting facilitates length generalization beyond seen chains of thought for language models of sufficient scale

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: tested only on limited symbolic tasks; performance degrades with length
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 7:
Statement: Chain-of-thought prompting is robust to different annotators, exemplars, and language models
Location: Section A.2
Type: Robustness finding
Quote: chain of thought performed better than the baseline by a large margin for all three annotators on eight datasets in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning

Evidence:
- Performance remained strong across different annotators and exemplar sets
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.4
  Limitations: Some variance in performance levels between annotators
  Quote: Although there is variance among different chain of thought annotations [...] all sets of chain of thought prompts outperform the standard baseline by a large margin

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: significant variance in performance across annotators; some tasks showed sensitivity to prompts
Confidence: medium
