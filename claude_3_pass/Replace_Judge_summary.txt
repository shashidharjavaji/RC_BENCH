=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: Using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL) correlates better with human judgments compared to a single large judge while being over 7x cheaper
Location: Abstract
Type: Primary result
Quote: We show that using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL) correlates better with human judgements compared to a single large judge (GPT-4), while being over seven times less expensive

Evidence:
- PoLL shows higher Cohen's kappa correlation with human judgments than GPT-4 on QA tasks while being much cheaper
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results section 4.1, Table 1
  Limitations: Limited to specific QA datasets tested
  Quote: We see that overall, PoLL has the strongest correlation across various tasks, while GPT-4 is one of the weaker evaluators on this particular task setup

- Cost comparison shows PoLL is much cheaper than GPT-4
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results section 4.5
  Limitations: Costs may vary over time
  Quote: the cost of running our specific instance of PoLL is $1.25/input + $4.25/output, whereas the cost of running GPT-4 Turbo is $10/input + $30/output

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Cost comparison is simplistic and may not account for all scenarios/implementations
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: GPT-4 is a relatively weak judge in some scenarios and shows high variance with minor prompt changes
Location: Abstract
Type: Finding
Quote: In some scenarios, GPT-4 is a relatively weak judge, exhibiting high variance with minor changes to the prompt

Evidence:
- GPT-4's performance varies significantly with prompt changes on NQ dataset
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results section 4.3, Table 3
  Limitations: Only tested on one dataset
  Quote: we can see how the correlation between GPT-4 and human annotators varies as the prompt changes. In all cases, having in-context examples improves the performance over zero-shot

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Only demonstrated on NQ dataset; may not generalize to other tasks
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: Using multiple heterogeneous evaluator models reduces intra-model scoring bias
Location: Abstract
Type: Finding
Quote: Intra-model scoring bias is reduced by pooling judgements across a panel of heterogeneous evaluator models

Evidence:
- PoLL reduces intra-model bias compared to individual judges
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Results section 4.4
  Limitations: Limited to specific test cases
  Quote: We observe that overall, PoLL has the smallest spread in scores, with a standard deviation of 2.2, compared to EM and individual judges

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited to specific model combinations tested; may vary with different panel compositions
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: PoLL has the strongest correlation with human judgments across various QA tasks
Location: Results/Correlation to Human Judgements
Type: Result
Quote: We see that overall, PoLL has the strongest correlation across various tasks, while GPT-4 is one of the weaker evaluators on this particular task setup

Evidence:
Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: No clear evidence presented in the excerpts
Confidence: low

Claim 5:
Statement: PoLL achieves the best correlation with human rankings on Chatbot Arena
Location: Results/Rank Correlation on Chatbot Arena
Type: Result
Quote: We find that PoLL is best correlated with the gold rankings, particularly at the top of the ranked list

Evidence:
- PoLL shows highest correlation with Chatbot Arena rankings
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results section 4.2, Table 2
  Limitations: Limited to one specific benchmark
  Quote: We find that PoLL is best correlated with the gold rankings, particularly at the top of the ranked list

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Limited to one specific benchmark; may not generalize to other evaluation scenarios
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: Having in-context examples improves GPT-4's performance as a judge
Location: Results/Judgement Variance by Prompt Changes
Type: Finding
Quote: In all cases, having in-context examples improves the performance over zero-shot

Evidence:
- In-context examples improve GPT-4's judge performance
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results section 4.3
  Limitations: Tested only on QA tasks
  Quote: In all cases, having in-context examples improves the performance over zero-shot

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Only tested on specific tasks; optimal number of examples not determined
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 7:
Statement: PoLL has the smallest spread in scores compared to individual judges
Location: Results/Judge Bias and Consistency
Type: Finding
Quote: We observe that overall, PoLL has the smallest spread in scores, with a standard deviation of 2.2, compared to EM and individual judges

Evidence:
- PoLL shows smallest variance in scores compared to individual judges
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results section 4.4
  Limitations: Limited to multi-hop datasets tested
  Quote: We observe that overall, PoLL has the smallest spread in scores, with a standard deviation of 2.2, compared to EM and individual judges. GPT-3.5 has the highest spread, with a standard deviation of 6.1.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited to specific datasets tested; standard deviation of 2.2 vs 6.1 only shown for one comparison
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 8:
Statement: Running PoLL is 7-8 times less expensive than running a single GPT-4 judge
Location: Results/Cost and Latency
Type: Cost comparison
Quote: Depending on the ratio of input-to-output tokens in a given task, running the entire three model PoLL is seven to eight times less expensive than running a single GPT-4 judge

Evidence:
- Cost comparison shows PoLL is 7-8x cheaper than GPT-4
  Strength: strong
  Location: Results section 4.5
  Limitations: Cost ratios may change over time
  Quote: Depending on the ratio of input-to-output tokens in a given task, running the entire three model PoLL is seven to eight times less expensive than running a single GPT-4 judge

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Based on specific pricing at time of writing; may change with pricing updates or different implementations
Confidence: high
