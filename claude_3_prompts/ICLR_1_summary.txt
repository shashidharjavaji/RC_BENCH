Location: Experimental Results and Discussion
Type: Performance Result
Quote: Among the features analyzed, CQCC achieved the highest classification accuracy, with the Random Forest classifier attaining an exceptional 99%, in contrast to the 63.4% accuracy achieved by the Support Vector Machine classifier.

Evidence:
- CQCC achieved 99% accuracy with RF for binary classification
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.2.1/Table 4
  Limitations: Only for binary classification task

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: CQCC features provide better class separation compared to MFCC features based on LDA analysis
Location: Feature Visualization Using LDA Plots
Type: Analysis Result
Quote: the LDA plot of CQCC features exhibits a clearer separation, especially between the ALS and Parkinson's disease classes...This stronger discriminative power indicates that CQCC features are more effective at distinguishing between neurodegenerative disorders and healthy individuals, making them a more robust feature set for classification tasks.

Evidence:
- LDA plots show clearer separation between classes for CQCC vs MFCC
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.2.3
  Limitations: Qualitative visual analysis
  Quote: the LDA plot of CQCC features exhibits a clearer separation, especially between the ALS and Parkinson's disease classes

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Visual analysis of LDA plots is somewhat subjective; quantitative metrics for separation not provided
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: CQCC provides superior spectrotemporal resolution for capturing fundamental frequency and harmonics in speech signals
Location: Abstract
Type: Technical Capability
Quote: Constant Q Cepstral Coefficients (CQCC), which leverage geometrically spaced frequency bins to provide superior spectrotemporal resolution, particularly for capturing the fundamental frequency and its harmonics in speech signals associated with neurodegenerative disorders.

Evidence:
- No direct experimental evidence comparing spectrotemporal resolution capabilities
  Strength: weak
  Location: None found in results/methods
  Limitations: Claim made without supporting experimental data
  Quote: None available

Conclusion:
Justified: False
Robustness: low
Limitations: Theoretical claim without direct experimental validation or comparative analysis
Confidence: low
