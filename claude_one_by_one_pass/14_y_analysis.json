The demonstration that improvements can be achieved without retraining suggests the underlying issue is indeed related to balancing existing capabilities rather than poor visual understanding. Results are consistent across different model sizes (7B and 13B) and evaluation methods (captioning and VQA tasks).",
                "limitations": "1. Testing limited to specific architectures (primarily LLaVA) and benchmarks (POPE, MS COCO)\n2. Focus on object hallucination rather than other types of hallucinations\n3. M3ID requires additional computation (two forward passes)\n4. Some evidence based on binary classification tasks which may not fully represent complex visual understanding\n5. Potential confounding factors in language prior effects not fully explored",
