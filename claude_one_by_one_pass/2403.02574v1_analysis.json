                "robustness_analysis": "The evidence demonstrates moderate to strong robustness through multiple evaluation approaches: (1) Quantitative metrics showing improvements across ROUGE and LLM-based evaluations, (2) Visualization of stability through boxplots for the Reflective Mechanism, and (3) Human evaluation confirming the findings. The use of multiple evaluation methods strengthens the reliability of the conclusions.",

Potential bias in LLM-based evaluation metrics\n4. Incomplete testing of all possible component combinations\n5. Absence of long-term stability testing",
