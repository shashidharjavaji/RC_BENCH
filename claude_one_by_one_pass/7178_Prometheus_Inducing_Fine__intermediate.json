                "justification_explanation": "The conclusion is justified through direct human evaluation comparing feedback quality between models. The methodology involves crowdsource workers conducting pairwise comparisons with specific evaluation criteria and explaining their choices. The slight discrepancy between the numbers (58.67% vs 58.62%) appears to be a minor typo rather than a substantive issue.",
                "robustness_analysis": "The evidence is relatively robust as it comes from direct human evaluation with a structured methodology including specific evaluation criteria and follow-up analysis of why evaluators made their choices. The study used 9 crowdsource workers split into three groups for comparisons between different model pairs (PROMETHEUS vs GPT-4, PROMETHEUS vs ChatGPT, GPT-4 vs ChatGPT), providing some measure of reliability.",

Potential evaluator bias is not discussed 4. Inter-rater reliability metrics are not provided 5. The small difference over 50% (58.62%) suggests the advantage, while real, is modest",

The ablation experiments systematically test the contribution of each reference material component, showing consistent patterns of degradation when materials are removed. The correlation scores provide concrete numerical evidence of the impact.",
