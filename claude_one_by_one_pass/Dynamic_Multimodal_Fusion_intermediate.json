                "conclusion_justified": true,
                "justification_explanation": "The conclusion is justified through both quantitative and qualitative evidence. The authors systematically tested performance under different noise conditions, demonstrated widening performance gaps as noise increases, and provided visual examples showing maintained performance under noise. The experimental methodology including controlled noise injection and comparative analysis strengthens the justification.",
                "robustness_analysis": "The evidence shows good robustness through multiple complementary approaches: 1) Quantitative performance comparisons under varying noise levels 2) Systematic testing with different noise injection probabilities 3) Visual demonstration of maintained performance under noise. The controlled experimental setup and multiple evaluation methods strengthen reliability.",

The numerical results clearly demonstrate both the computational savings and minimal accuracy impact claimed.",
