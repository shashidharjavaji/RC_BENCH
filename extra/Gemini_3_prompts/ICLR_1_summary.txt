Claim 7:
Statement: CQCC features are form-invariant, ensuring consistent feature representation across varying pitch and tonal conditions.
Location: Methods
Type: Improvement
Quote: The CQT of a signal wp(m) is given by: 2π � M (r) _[P m]_ 1 Wp[CQT] (r) = _M_ (r)−1 � _−j_ β β _|_ _|_ _[Y]_ indicating that scaling the time domain by a factor of β corresponds to scaling the frequency domain by the inverse factor _β[1]_ [. This shows that the structure of the energy spectral density (ESD) remains unchanged, which is why this property is referred to as "form-invariance."

Evidence:
- CQCC features are form-invariant, ensuring consistent feature representation across varying pitch and tonal conditions.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Methodology
  Limitations: None
  Quote: For simplicity, we examine the continuous-time forms of the Fourier Transform (FT), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and Constant-Q Transform (CQT).
