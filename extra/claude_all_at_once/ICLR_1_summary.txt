Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: CQCC outperforms MFCC in classifying neurodegenerative disorders
Location: Section 5.2.1
Exact Quote: CQCC achieved the highest classification accuracy, with the Random Forest classifier attaining an exceptional 99%, in contrast to the 63.4% accuracy achieved by the Support Vector Machine classifier

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: RF classification results showing CQCC vs MFCC performance
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 4
  Limitations: Limited to specific dataset D2
  Exact Quote: RF Accuracy (%): CQCC: 99.0, MFCC: 95.1

- Evidence Text: Multi-pathology classification results
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 5
  Limitations: Results specific to databases D1 and D3
  Exact Quote: CQCC features outperform the baseline MFCC features with an absolute increment of 5.6% and 7.7% on RF and SVM classifiers, respectively

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Multiple experiments across different datasets consistently show CQCC outperforming MFCC
Key Limitations: Results may be dataset-dependent

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: CQCC provides better class separation for neurodegenerative disorders compared to MFCC
Location: Section 5.2.3
Exact Quote: LDA plot of CQCC features exhibits a clearer separation, especially between the ALS and Parkinson's disease classes

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: LDA visualization analysis
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.2.3
  Limitations: Visual analysis is qualitative
  Exact Quote: ALS samples are tightly clustered on the far left, showing a distinct separation from the Parkinson and Healthy Control classes

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: Visual evidence supported by quantitative classification results
Key Limitations: Relies partly on qualitative visual assessment

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: performance
Statement: Random Forest performs better than SVM for CQCC-based classification
Location: Section 5.2.1, Tables 4-6
Exact Quote: RF with CQCC attaining an exceptional 99%, in contrast to the 63.4% accuracy achieved by the Support Vector Machine classifier

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Binary classification results
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 4
  Limitations: Specific to binary classification scenario
  Exact Quote: RF Accuracy (%): 99.0, SVM Accuracy (%): 63.4 for CQCC

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: Consistent performance advantage shown across multiple experiments
Key Limitations: Limited to specific classifier configurations
