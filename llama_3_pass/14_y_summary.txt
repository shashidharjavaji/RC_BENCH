Claim 4:
Statement: Object hallucinations in VLMs result from excessive reliance on the language prior rather than a poor understanding of the visual modality.
Location: Section 6. Conclusions
Type: Finding/Insight
Quote: A limitation of M3ID is that it requires two forward passes at inference time, one for the conditioned and one for the unconditioned prediction.

Evidence:
- In fact, M3ID at inference time is sufficient to significantly reduce the amount of generated hallucinations without any training.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6. Conclusions
  Limitations: None

Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: M3ID may prevent the generation of objects that are highly likely under the unprompted language prior due to context clues.
Location: Section 6. Conclusions
Type: Limitation/Drawback
Quote: While we already showed that this can be mitigated with proper hyperparameter selection, we believe that an interesting avenue for future research is to directly encode this preference within the model’s weights by favoring the generation of structured captions that get progressively more detailed while still being grounded to the image.

  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 6. Conclusions
  Limitations: Requires proper hyperparameter selection

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: low
Limitations: Dependence on proper hyperparameter selection, potential impact on linguistic fluency
Confidence: low
