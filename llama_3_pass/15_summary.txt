Claim 1:
Statement: Large language models can reason effectively without prompting by simply altering the decoding process.
Location: Abstract
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: Our study takes a novel approach by asking: Can LLMs reason effectively without prompting? Our findings reveal that, intriguingly, CoT reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained LLMs by simply altering the decoding process.

Evidence:
- Table 1 shows example decoding paths across math (GSM8K) and commonsense reasoning (year parity) tasks, where alternative top-𝑘 tokens at the first decoding step reveal natural CoT reasoning in many cases.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.1
  Limitations: Limited to specific tasks and models
  Quote: LLMs indeed cannot reason if we only consider the greedy decoding path. However, when we consider alternative top-𝑘 (𝑘> 0) tokens at the first decoding step, an intriguing phenomenon emerges...

- Figure 2 highlights the impact of alternative token consideration in subsequent decoding steps, showing that early branching significantly enhances the diversity of potential paths.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 2.1
  Limitations: Limited to specific tasks and models
  Quote: Conversely, later-stage branching is significantly influenced by previously generated tokens.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: None
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: CoT-decoding can reliably extract CoT-paths based on answer confidence.
Location: Section 2.2
Type: Methodological Advancement
Quote: We find that the language model’s confidence in its final answers increases when a CoT is present in its decoding path. Leveraging this increased confidence, we propose CoT-decoding to select more reliable decoding paths, demonstrating significant improvements over greedy decoding across various reasoning benchmarks.

Evidence:
- Table 1 illustrates that CoT paths do not consistently outrank non-CoT ones in the model’s probability assessment, but the presence of a CoT path correlates with increased model confidence in decoding its final answer.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.2
  Limitations: Limited to specific tasks and models
  Quote: Interestingly, upon examining the model’s logits, we found that the presence of a CoT path typically leads to a more confident decoding of the final answer...

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: None
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: CoT-decoding effectively elicits reasoning across multiple language model families and model scales.
Location: Section 3.1
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: Across three language model families, PaLM-2, Mistral and Gemma, CoT-decoding effectively elicits model’s reasoning, yielding consistent accuracy gains over both math and commonsense reasoning tasks, sometimes doubling or even tripling the performance compared to greedy decoding.

Evidence:
- Figure 3 shows that across three language model families (PaLM-2, Mistral, and Gemma), CoT-decoding effectively elicits model’s reasoning, yielding consistent accuracy gains over both math and commonsense reasoning tasks.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.1
  Limitations: Limited to specific tasks and models
  Quote: CoT-decoding effectively elicits reasoning across language models.

- Table 4 compares popular decoding baselines on the Mistral-7B pre-trained model, showing that CoT-decoding is the only decoding strategy that significantly enhances language models’ reasoning.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.1
  Limitations: Limited to specific tasks and models
  Quote: CoT-decoding is the only decoding strategy that can significantly enhance language models’ reasoning.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: None
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: CoT-decoding partially closes the reasoning gap between pre-trained and instruction-tuned models without using any supervised data.
Location: Section 3.1
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: Intriguingly, we observe that CoT-decoding enables a pre-trained model to achieve a similar performance of an instruction-tuned model: in Figure 4 (left), CoT-decoding achieves 63.2% accuracy on the pre-trained PaLM-2 Large model, close to the performance of the instruction-tuned model of the same scale at 67.8%.

Evidence:
- Figure 4 shows that CoT-decoding enhances reasoning across different model scales over the PaLM-2 model family, with significant accuracy gains on GSM8K and year parity tasks.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.1
  Limitations: Limited to specific tasks and models
  Quote: CoT-decoding reliably improves reasoning performance across model scales (PaLM-2).

- Table 5 shows that CoT-decoding can further improve the instruction-tuned model (Mistral-7B), achieving a similar performance to the pre-trained model with CoT-decoding.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3.1
  Limitations: Limited to specific tasks and models
  Quote: CoT-decoding partially closes the reasoning gap between pre-trained and instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Dependence on specific model families and tasks
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: CoT-decoding can be combined with CoT-prompting to yield even larger reasoning gains.
Location: Section 3.3
Type: Methodological Advancement
Quote: We further show that CoT-decoding can be easily combined with CoT-prompting, yielding even larger reasoning gains over multiple language models (Table 7).

Evidence:
- Table 7 shows that combining CoT-decoding with zero-shot CoT-prompting can further boost the reasoning performance on both models (Mistral-7B and PaLM-2 Large).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: Limited to specific tasks and models
  Quote: Adding CoT-decoding on top of zero-shot CoT-prompting can further boost the reasoning performance.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: None
Confidence: high
