    "raw_claims": "This is a research paper titled \"EUREKA: Human-Level Reward Design Via Coding Large Language Models\". Here's a breakdown of the paper's contents:\n\n**Abstract**\n\n* Introduces EUREKA, a human-level reward design algorithm powered by coding large language models (LLMs)\n* EUREKA achieves human-level performance on a diverse suite of 29 open-source RL environments, outperforming human experts on 83% of tasks with an average normalized improvement of 52%\n\n**Introduction**\n\n* Discusses the challenge of learning complex low-level manipulation tasks, such as dexterous pen spinning, using LLMs\n* Introduces EUREKA as a solution to bridge the gap between high-level semantic planning and low-level manipulation tasks\n\n**Method**\n\n* **Environment as Context**: Feeds the raw environment source code as context to the LLM, enabling zero-shot generation of executable reward functions\n* **Evolutionary Search**: Performs iterative optimization to improve the quality of the reward functions, proposing new improved rewards from the best one in the previous iteration\n* **Reward Reflection**: Provides automated feedback to summarize the policy training dynamics, enabling targeted reward editing\n\n**Experiments**\n\n* Evaluates EUREKA on a diverse suite of robot embodiments and tasks, testing its ability to generate reward functions, solve new tasks, and incorporate human input\n* Compares EUREKA to baselines: L2R (a two-stage LLM-prompting solution), Human (original shaped reward functions), and Sparse (identical to the fitness functions F)\n* Results:\n\t+ EUREKA outperforms Human and L2R across all tasks, with significant gains on high-dimensional dexterity environments\n\t+ EUREKA consistently improves over time, with its evolutionary optimization being indispensable for its final performance\n\t+ EUREKA generates novel rewards, with weak correlations to human rewards, and can discover novel reward design principles that may run counter to human intuition\n\t+ EUREKA enables a new gradient-free in-context learning approach to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), incorporating human reward initialization and textual feedback\n\n**Related Work**\n\n* Discusses prior work on reward design, inverse reinforcement learning, and using LLMs for decision-making and robotics problems\n* Highlights the novelty of EUREKA in generating free-form, white-box reward code and effectively improving rewards in-context\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n* Summarizes the contributions of EUREKA, including its human-level reward generation, ability to solve dexterous pen spinning, and enablement of a gradient-free approach to RLHF\n* Suggests that the principle of combining LLMs with evolutionary algorithms is a general and scalable approach to reward design, applicable to difficult, open-ended search problems.",
