Claim 1:
Statement: Combining tabular data from financial semi-structured documents with text transcripts and audio recordings improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12%.
Location: Abstract
Type: Methodological Contribution
Quote: Financial prediction is complex due to the stochastic nature of the stock market.... We show that combining tabular data from financial semi-structured documents with text transcripts and audio recordings improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12%.

Evidence:
- Table 3 shows the performance of several baseline and SOTA models for predicting price movement and stock volatility for Merger & Acquisition calls on the M&A dataset. We observe significant gains (8-12%) in both tasks across attention based (MDRM, VoLTAGE, MMFTR) and Transformer models (M3A) by combining tabular information extracted from financial semi-structured documents with text-audio time series.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4: Results and Discussion
  Limitations: Results are specific to the M&A dataset and may not generalize to other datasets.
  Quote: We observe significant gains (8-12%) in both tasks across attention based (MDRM, VoLTAGE, MMFTR) and Transformer models (M3A) by combining tabular information extracted from financial semi-structured documents with text-audio time series.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Dataset-specific, may not generalize to other financial prediction tasks
Confidence: high

Claim 2:
Statement: The proposed approach reduces gender bias learned by audio-based neural networks by over 30%.
Location: Abstract
Type: Methodological Contribution
Quote: ... reduces gender bias caused due to audio-based neural networks by over 30%.

Evidence:
- We evaluate the gender bias in SOTA M3A model by quantifying the error disparity in MSE/F1 score between male and non-male speakers (∆G = MSEF − MSE_M /F1M − F1F ) for individual text, audio and table inputs and their combinations across 3, 7 and 15-day intervals in Table 6. We observe that the table modality has the least error disparity, and the addition of tabular information reduces gender bias by over 30%.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1: Bias Reduction through Company Filings
  Limitations: Results are based on a specific evaluation metric (∆G) and may not capture all aspects of gender bias.
  Quote: We observe that the table modality has the least error disparity, and the addition of tabular information reduces gender bias by over 30%.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Dependent on the specific model (M3A) and datasets used
Confidence: high

Claim 3:
Statement: The addition of tabular information extracted from company filing data to verbal-vocal cues shows a gain of 10-12% across different settings.
Location: Section 4. Results and Discussion
Type: Empirical Finding
Quote: Unimodal settings severely underperform across both tasks. The addition of tabular information extracted from company filing data to verbal-vocal cues shows a gain of 10-12% across different settings.

Evidence:
- Table 5 shows the ablation analysis of M3A model augmented with DocEmbedding for each modality for volatility (MSE) and price movement prediction (F1 score) tasks across Earnings Calls and M&A calls datasets. The addition of tabular information extracted from company filing data to verbal-vocal cues shows a gain of 10-12% across different settings.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4: Results and Discussion
  Limitations: Results are based on a specific ablation analysis and may not generalize to other models or datasets.
  Quote: The addition of tabular information extracted from company filing data to verbal-vocal cues shows a gain of 10-12% across different settings.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Ablation study has limited scope, may not represent all possible settings
Confidence: medium

Claim 4:
Statement: Utilizing tabular information as an alternative to audio input for multimodal financial prediction tasks can reduce unwanted stereotypes arising due to gender-specific audio features.
Location: Section 4.2 Audio vs Tabular Information
Type: Methodological Contribution
Quote: Hence, we propose to utilize tabular information as an effective substitute for audio input for multimodal financial prediction tasks.

Evidence:
- As evident from Table 5 and 6, tabular information preserves model performance while avoiding unwanted stereotypes arising due to gender-specific audio features such as shimmer and jitter. Hence, we propose to utilize tabular information as an effective substitute for audio input for multimodal financial prediction tasks.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4: Results and Discussion
  Limitations: The proposal is based on the observed results and may require further validation.
  Quote: tabular information preserves model performance while avoiding unwanted stereotypes arising due to gender-specific audio features...

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Assumes that tabular information can effectively replace audio input in all cases
Confidence: high
