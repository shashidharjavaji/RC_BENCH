Claim 1:
Statement: Feed-forward layers in transformer-based language models operate as key-value memories.
Location: Abstract
Type: Novel finding
Quote: Feed-forward layers constitute two-thirds of a transformer model’s parameters, yet their role in the network remains under-explored. We show that feed-forward layers in transformer-based language models operate as key-value memories, where each key correlates with textual patterns in the training examples, and each value induces a distribution over the output vocabulary.

Evidence:
- Comparing equations 1 and 2 shows that feed-forward layers are almost identical to key-value neural memories; the only difference is that neural memory uses softmax as the non-linearity f ( ), while the canonical transformer does not use a normalizing function in the feed-forward layer.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2: Feed-Forward Layers as Unnormalized Key-Value Memories
  Limitations: theoretical similarity, not empirical

Conclusion:
Justified: True

Limitations: Assumes similarity between neural memory and feed-forward layers based on mathematical formulation
Confidence: high

Claim 2:
Statement: Keys in feed-forward layers capture human-interpretable input patterns.
Location: Section 3
Type: Novel finding
Quote: Experts were able to identify at least one pattern for every key, with an average of 3.6 identified patterns per key. Furthermore, the vast majority of retrieved prefixes (65%-80%) were associated with at least one identified pattern.

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: Values in upper layers of feed-forward layers induce distributions over the output vocabulary that correlate with the next-token distribution of patterns in the corresponding key.
Location: Section 4
Type: Novel finding
Quote: The agreement rate between the top-ranked token based on the value vector vi[ℓ] and the next token of the top-ranked trigger example associated with the key vector k[ℓ]i is close to zero in the lower layers (1-10), but starting from layer 11, the agreement rate quickly rises until 3.5%.

Evidence:
- Figure 4 shows the agreement rate between the top-ranked token based on the value vector vi[ℓ] and the next token of the top-ranked trigger example associated with the key vector k[ℓ]i, which increases in upper layers.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4: Values Represent Distributions
  Limitations: based on quantitative analysis
  Quote: Figure 4 shows the agreement rate between the top-ranked token based on the value vector vi[ℓ] and the next token of the top-ranked trigger example associated with the key vector k[ℓ]i.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific to upper layers, might not generalize to all layers or models
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: The model’s output is formed via an aggregation of distributions from individual layer outputs, which are then refined throughout the model’s layers using residual connections.
Location: Section 5
Type: Novel finding
Quote: Every feed-forward layer composes multiple memories to produce a distribution that is qualitatively different from each of its component memories’ value distributions. These layer-wise distributions are then combined via residual connections in a refinement process, where each feed-forward layer updates the residual’s distribution to finally form the model’s output.

Evidence:
- Figure 8 shows that, for any layer in the network, the layer’s final prediction is different than every one of the memories’ predictions in at least 68% of the examples.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.1: Intra-Layer Memory Composition
  Limitations: based on quantitative analysis
  Quote: Figure 8 shows that, for any layer in the network, the layer’s final prediction is different than every one of the memories’ predictions in at least 68% of the examples.

- Figure 9 shows that roughly a third of the model’s predictions are determined in the bottom few layers, and Figure 10 shows the probability of the token output by the model according to the residual of each layer.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.2: Inter-Layer Prediction Refinement
  Limitations: based on quantitative analysis
  Quote: Figure 9 shows that roughly a third of the model’s predictions are determined in the bottom few layers, and Figure 10 shows the probability of the token output by the model according to the residual of each layer.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Based on analysis of a specific model and dataset, might not be universally applicable
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Feed-forward layers tune the residual predictions at varying granularity, even in the last layer of the model.
Location: Section 5.2
Type: Novel finding
Quote: In most cases (66 examples), the output changes to a semantically distant word (e.g., “people” → “same”) and in the rest of the cases (34 examples), the feed-forward layer’s output shifts the residual prediction to a related word (e.g. “later” → “earlier” and “gastric” → “stomach”).

Evidence:
- Manual analysis of 100 random cases of last-layer composition found that in most cases (66 examples), the output changes to a semantically distant word, and in the rest of the cases (34 examples), the feed-forward layer’s output shifts the residual prediction to a related word.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5.2: Inter-Layer Prediction Refinement
  Limitations: based on manual analysis of a limited sample

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Based on manual analysis of a limited number of cases, might not be representative of all scenarios
Confidence: medium
