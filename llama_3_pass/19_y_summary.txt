   - **Claim Type:** Novel Finding
   - **Exact Quote:** "Tab. 4 shows the results, where our MAT brings a +1.4% on MSVD-QA, + 2.2% MSRVTT-QA, and +1.6% ActivityNet-QA than PT."

4. **Claim ID:** 4
   - **Claim Text:** "Integrating both visual and auditory modalities consistently enhances performance across various video understanding benchmarks."
   - **Location:** Section 4.3 Ablation Studies
   - **Claim Type:** Novel Finding
   - **Exact Quote:** "As illustrated in Fig. 14, integrating both visual and auditory modalities, instead of relying on a single modality, consistently enhances performance across various video understanding benchmarks."

5. **Claim ID:** 5
   - **Claim Text:** "Increasing the size of the multimodal encoders and LLM backbone leads to performance improvements."
   - **Location:** Section 4.3 Ablation Studies
   - **Claim Type:** Novel Finding
   - **Exact Quote:** "As shown from Tab. 5 to Tab. 7, we observe that increasing the size of the multimodal encoders and LLM backbone leads to performance improvements."

6. **Claim ID:** 6
   - **Claim Text:** "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can achieve comparable results with fewer GPU resources, but there is still a gap compared to full tuning."
   - **Location:** Section 4.3 Ablation Studies
   - **Claim Type:** Novel Finding
   - **Exact Quote:** "The results in Tab. 11 show that LoRA can achieve comparable results with fewer GPU resources. However, there is still a gap compared to full tuning."
