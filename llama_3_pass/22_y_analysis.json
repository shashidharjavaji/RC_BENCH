We propose to use the large-scale vision-language foundation model for early alignment and transformer for deep fusion to establish multi-modal correspondence, resulting in high-quality language-aware visual representations for localization reasoning. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against the state-of-the-arts."
