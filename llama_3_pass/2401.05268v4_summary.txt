Claim 3:
Statement: AUTOACT decouples the planning process and reaches a clear division-of-labor among sub-agents for group planning, resulting in an improvement over FIREACT.
Location: Section 4 Results
Type: Improvement
Quote: AUTOACT decouples the planning process and reaches a clear division-of-labor among sub-agents for group planning, resulting in an improvement over FIREACT.

Evidence:
- AUTOACT decouples the planning process and reaches a clear division-of-labor among sub-agents for group planning, resulting in an improvement over FIREACT, with ↑5.77% on HotpotQA and ↑6.67% on ScienceQA with the Llama-70B model.
  Strength: strong
  Location: §4 Results
  Limitations: Specific to Llama-70B model
  Quote: AUTOACT decouples the planning process and reaches a clear division-of-labor among sub-agents for group planning, resulting in an improvement over FIREACT, with ↑5.77% on HotpotQA and ↑6.67% on ScienceQA with the Llama-70B model.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific model (Llama-70B) and datasets (HotpotQA and ScienceQA)

Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific model (Llama-70B) and datasets (HotpotQA and ScienceQA)
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Larger training data scale does not necessarily mean better results.
Location: Section 5 Analysis
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: Larger training data scale does not necessarily mean better results.

Evidence:
- Fig. 3 (a-c), showing that the overall performance of different models goes to stability with minimal waves once the data scale exceeds 200.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: §5 Analysis
  Limitations: Specific to Fig. 3 (a-c)
  Quote: the overall performance of different models goes to stability with minimal waves once the data scale exceeds 200.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Data scale exceeding 200 may not always lead to better results, and the analysis is based on a specific experiment
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: Moderate division-of-labor benefits group planning performance.
Location: Section 5 Analysis
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: Moderate division-of-labor benefits group planning performance.

Evidence:
- Fig. 4, showing that excessive differentiation (Tool-Specified) not only fails to achieve better results but can sometimes even be less effective than not differentiating (One) at all.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: §5 Analysis
  Limitations: Specific to Fig. 4
  Quote: excessive differentiation (Tool-Specified) not only fails to achieve better results but can sometimes even be less effective than not differentiating (One) at all.
