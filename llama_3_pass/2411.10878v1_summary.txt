=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: Fine-tuned LLMs outperform non-fine-tuned models in generating relevant meta-analysis abstracts.
Location: Section III. METHODOLOGY, Subsection B. Results and Analysis
Type: Novel finding, improvement, or advancement
Quote: After fine-tuning the LLMs, human evaluation of the generated outputs is essential. We applied our proposed human evaluation metrics—Relevant, Somewhat-Relevant, and Irrelevant—to assess the results of the meta-analysis generation task. As shown in Table III, our approach of fine-tuning LLMs with large context dataset, MAD outperforms other methods, producing more relevant meta-analysis content and reducing unnecessary context generation.

Evidence:
- Table III: Human evaluation is done on generated meta-analysis abstract by fine-tuned and non-fine-tuned LLMs, following the criteria REL: Relevant, SWR: Somewhat-Relevant, and IRL: Irrelevant. The results show that fine-tuned Llama-2 (7B) and Mistral-v0.1 (7B) outperformed their non-fine-tuned versions by generating significantly relevant meta-analyses.
