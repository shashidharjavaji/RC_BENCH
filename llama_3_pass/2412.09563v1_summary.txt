**Title:** Does Representation Matter? Exploring Intermediate Layers in Large Language Models

**Authors:** Oscar Skean, Md Rifat Arefin, Yann LeCun, and Ravid Shwartz-Ziv

**Summary:**

This paper investigates the quality of intermediate representations in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their impact on downstream task performance. The authors apply various evaluation metrics (prompt entropy, curvature, InfoNCE, LiDAR, and DiME) to assess representation quality across different layers of LLM architectures (Transformers and State Space Models). The study reveals that:

1. **Intermediate layers outperform final layers** in representation quality for downstream tasks.
2. **Transformers exhibit greater representational variability** and information compression in intermediate layers, whereas State Space Models display more stable representations.
3. **Training progression** significantly improves representation quality in intermediate layers.
4. **Extreme input conditions** (token repetition, randomness, and prompt length) distinctly affect intermediate layer representations.
5. A **bimodal distribution of prompt entropies** is observed in intermediate layers of Transformer models, with an unknown underlying cause.

**Methodology:**

1. **Notation and Architectures:** The paper defines notation for representing batches of samples and describes the architectures of Transformers and State Space Models.
2. **Representation Evaluation Metrics:** The authors apply two categories of metrics:
	* **Token Embedding Diversity Metrics:** prompt entropy and curvature.
	* **Augmentation-Invariance Metrics:** InfoNCE, LiDAR, and DiME.
3. **Experiments:**
	* **Downstream Task Performance:** Evaluate representations at each model layer on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB).
	* **Representation Quality:** Apply metrics to quantify representation quality across layers in various settings (architectural differences, training progression, input randomness, and prompt length).

**Key Findings:**

1. **Intermediate layers are crucial** for downstream task performance, often outperforming final layers.
2. **Architectural differences** in representation quality exist between Transformers and State Space Models.
3. **Training progression** significantly impacts representation quality, particularly in intermediate layers.
4. **Extreme input conditions** affect intermediate layer representations in distinct ways.
5. **Bimodal entropy distribution** in Transformer models' intermediate layers remains an open question.

**Implications:**

1. **Model Optimization:** Understanding intermediate layer behavior can inform architectural design and training strategies.
2. **Representation Evaluation:** The study highlights the importance of evaluating representation quality across layers, not just final layers.
3. **Downstream Task Performance:** Leveraging intermediate layers can improve performance in various NLP tasks.

**Limitations and Future Work:**

1. **Bimodal Entropy Distribution:** The underlying cause of this phenomenon in Transformer models remains unknown.
2. **Further Metric Development:** Creating new metrics tailored to LLMs can enhance representation evaluation.
3. **Exploring Other Architectures:** Investigating representation quality in other LLM architectures can provide a more comprehensive understanding.
