Claim 2:
Statement: The IPCC reports serve as an authoritative source of scientific findings on climate change.
Location: Introduction
Type: Established Fact
Quote: However, the IPCC reports serve as an authoritative source of scientific findings on climate change.

Evidence:
- The IPCC has developed protocols to recruit experts, evaluate a large body of literature, and encode uncertainties and consensus, which make the scientific statements in these reports more robust.

  Limitations: None
  Quote: The IPCC has developed protocols to recruit experts (IPCC 2024a), evaluate a large body of literature (IPCC 2024b), and encode uncertainties and consensus (Mastrandrea et al. 2010), which make the scientific statements in these reports more robust.

Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: None
Confidence: high

==================================================

Statement: Our analysis shows that WGII has a higher proportion of high and very-high confidence statements.
Location: Extracting and Profiling Statements from IPCC AR6
Type: Analytical Finding
Quote: Our analysis shows that WGII has a higher proportion of high and very-high confidence statements.

Evidence:
- Figure 2 shows the breakdown of confidence levels across different parts of each WG report, with WGII having a higher proportion of high and very-high confidence statements.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section: Extracting and Profiling Statements from IPCC AR6, Figure 2
  Limitations: None
  Quote: Figure 2: A treemap of statements by confidence levels (very high, high, medium, low, very low) and sources (ChapBody, ChapSumm, TechSumm, SummPol) for IPCC AR6 WGI, WGII, and WGIII reports.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: None
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Over 90% of the overall statements have confidence levels above medium (i.e., medium, high, or very high).
Location: Extracting and Profiling Statements from IPCC AR6
Type: Analytical Finding
Quote: Over 90% of the overall statements have confidence levels above medium (i.e., medium, high, or very high).

Evidence:
- Figure 2 shows that over 90% of the overall statements have confidence levels above medium (i.e., medium, high, or very high).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section: Extracting and Profiling Statements from IPCC AR6, Figure 2
  Limitations: None
  Quote: Figure 2: A treemap of statements by confidence levels (very high, high, medium, low, very low) and sources (ChapBody, ChapSumm, TechSumm, SummPol) for IPCC AR6 WGI, WGII, and WGIII reports.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: None
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 6:
Statement: The majority of statements in L also located in chapter bodies, and the likelihood labels are quite imbalanced, over 80% of L are with a likely label or a very likely label.
Location: Appendix 1: Uncertainty Degrees Defined in the IPCC AR6
Type: Analytical Finding
Quote: The majority of statements in L also located in chapter bodies, and the likelihood labels are quite imbalanced, over 80% of L are with a likely label or a very likely label.

Evidence:
- Table 4 shows the distribution of likelihood levels in Statements, with over 80% of L being with a likely label or a very likely label.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Appendix 1, Table 4
  Limitations: None
  Quote: Table 4: Distribution of likelihood levels in Statements, including the number of statements by likelihood label: Summary for Policymakers (SummPol), Technical Summary (TechSumm), Executive Summary of Chapters (ChapSumm) and the remaining Chapter contents (ChapCont).

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: None
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 7:
Statement: The method of linking statements based on semantic similarity has high precision but may miss valid links due to the complexity in sentence structures and wording.
Location: Case Study 1: Linking Statements Across AR6
Type: Methodological Limitation
Quote: This outcome demonstrates the high precision of this semantic similarity-based method. However, the method may miss valid links as the recall is undetermined.

Evidence:
- The method of linking statements based on semantic similarity has high precision but may miss valid links due to the complexity in sentence structures and wording, as shown in Figure 6.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section: Case Study 1: Linking Statements Across AR6, Figure 6
  Limitations: May miss valid links
  Quote: Figure 6: Setting different threshold θ, the corresponding difference in average similarity score between linked and not linked statement pairs.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: May miss valid links
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 8:
Statement: The supporting reference detection methodology is precise but requires further evaluation of recall in future work.
Location: Case Study 2: Supporting References
Type: Methodological Evaluation
Quote: This variation potentially validates the precision of our approach in using text-based analysis to extract and link supporting references to statements.

Evidence:
- The supporting reference detection methodology is precise but requires further evaluation of recall in future work, as shown in the word cloud of the concatenated abstracts in Figure 4.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section: Case Study 2: Supporting References, Figure 4
  Limitations: Requires further evaluation of recall
  Quote: Figure 4: Word clouds generated from the abstracts of papers supporting the statements s1 (left) and s2 (right).

Claim 9:
Statement: GPT-generated statements often cite inaccurate IPCC sections and lack uncertainty assessment information.
Location: Case Study 3: A Comparison with GPT Extracted Statements
Type: Comparative Analysis
Quote: Unlike our method, the zero-shot GPT model often produces statements that cite inaccurate IPCC sections.... GPT-generated statements lack uncertainty assessment information as we do.

Evidence:
- The GPT-generated statements often cite inaccurate IPCC sections and lack uncertainty assessment information, as shown in the comparison with our retrieved statements in Table 7.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section: Case Study 3: A Comparison with GPT Extracted Statements, Table 7
