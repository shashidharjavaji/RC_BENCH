    "raw_claims": "This is a research paper titled \"Language Models (Mostly) Know What They Know\" by Saurav Kadavath et al. Here's a breakdown of the paper's content:\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThe paper explores whether language models can evaluate the validity of their own claims and predict which questions they will answer correctly. The authors show that larger models are well-calibrated on diverse multiple-choice and true/false questions when provided in the right format. They then investigate self-evaluation, where models propose answers and evaluate their probability of being correct (P(True)). The authors also train models to predict whether they can answer questions correctly (P(IK)).\n\n**Contributions**\n\n1. **Calibration**: Large models are well-calibrated on multiple-choice and true/false questions when provided in the right format.\n2. **Self-Evaluation**: Models can self-evaluate their own samples, with performance improving with model size and when showing multiple samples.\n3. **P(IK) Training**: Models can be trained to predict whether they can answer questions correctly, with generalization across tasks, but struggling with calibration out-of-distribution.\n\n**Related Work**\n\n* Calibration for general ML predictions and language models\n* Selective prediction and truthfulness in language models\n\n**Models and Evaluation Tasks**\n\n* The authors study a series of language models with 800M, 3B, 12B, and 52B parameters.\n* Evaluations include BIG Bench, MMLU, TruthfulQA, LogiQA, QuALITY, TriviaQA, Lambada, Codex HumanEval, GSM8k, arithmetic problems, and Python function synthesis problems.\n\n**Section 2: Larger Models are Calibrated on Diverse Multiple Choice Questions**\n\n* The authors show that language models produce well-calibrated probabilities when choosing from explicit options.\n* Calibration improves with model size and few-shot evaluation.\n* The authors use a format with visible lettered answer options, which is crucial for achieving good calibration.\n\n**Section 3: From Calibration to Knowing What You Know**\n\n* The authors modify multiple-choice evaluations by replacing the final option with \"none of the above,\" which degrades performance and calibration.\n* Models are well-calibrated on true/false tasks, but struggle with calibration when evaluating their own samples.\n\n**Section 4: Ask the AI: Is your proposed answer True or False?**\n\n* The authors apply the true/false approach to model-generated samples, with self-evaluation performance improving with model size.\n* Showing multiple samples improves self-evaluation, especially on short-answer tasks.\n\n**Section 5: Training Models to Predict Whether They Can Answer Questions Correctly**\n\n* The authors train models to predict P(IK) using a value head approach.\n* P(IK) generalizes across tasks, but with poor calibration out-of-distribution.\n* The authors study the effect of including source materials and hints on P(IK) scores.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n* Large language models can evaluate the validity of their own claims and predict which questions they will answer correctly.\n* Self-evaluation performance improves with model size and when showing multiple samples.\n* Models can be trained to predict whether they can answer questions correctly, but struggle with calibration out-of-distribution.\n\n**Future Work**\n\n* Investigating honesty in language models, including truthfulness, calibration, self-knowledge, explainability, and non-deceptiveness.\n* Exploring the application of metacognition/self-evaluation to improve natural language calibration.",
