Claim 1:
Statement: FuseMix, a multimodal augmentation scheme, operates on latent space and is inspired by mixup.
Location: Section 2. Related Work, Subsection Data Augmentation
Type: Method/Technique
Quote: Data Augmentation. Historically, data augmentations were introduced in an effort to synthetically increase dataset size and diversity [43, 73]: this is exactly our goal, as we operate in a setting with relatively scarce paired multimodal data. In the natural image domain, common augmentations include horizontal flips, random crops, and color jitter [6, 13], which were designed to leave semantic information unchanged. However, designing such augmentations in any given domain requires expert knowledge of which transformations preserve semantic information. For example, na¨ıvely applying color jitter on the medical image domain can destroy the most relevant information for tasks like cancer classification [72, 77]. Furthermore, handcrafted augmentation schemes typically do not readily transfer to other modalities. This effect is evidenced by the scarcity of modality-agnostic augmentation schemes, despite recent efforts therein such as random projections [77] and randomized quantization [94]. We note that while input masking has been successfully applied in various modalities, expert knowledge is still required to determine an appropriate masking strategy for each modality individually [21, 32, 34, 84]. Given these challenges, it is unsurprising that data augmentations are not as well studied for multimodal learning [30]. In our work, we propose a multimodal augmentation scheme that operates on latent space and is inspired by mixup.

- FuseMix applies mixup on each latent space, importantly sharing the mixing coefficient across modalities, and is used as a modality-agnostic data augmentation.

Claim 2:
Statement: FuseMix applies mixup on each latent space, importantly sharing the mixing coefficient across modalities, and is used as a modality-agnostic data augmentation.
Location: Section 5.2. FuseMix: Multimodal Latent Mixup
Type: Method/Technique
Quote: Given our aim of performing multimodal fusion with minimal samples of paired data, it would seem intuitive to also leverage data augmentations to generate synthetic multimodal pairs (˜x, ˜y). However, constructing semantically meaningful data augmentations directly on the ambient spaces and is generally challenging due to the heterogeneity of multimodal data [30]. On the other hand, we note that ZX and ZY provide a more homogeneous alternative since they are both intermediate latent spaces of pre-trained unimodal encoders. Additionally, they already encode semantic information that can be beneficial for creating meaningful data augmentations. As such, we introduce a simple yet effective multimodal augmentation scheme on latent space that is agnostic to both the involved modalities and the choice of unimodal encoders. Our approach, which we call FuseMix, is inspired by mixup [106], in that augmented samples are generated from random convex combinations. In particular, we take linear interpolations between samples in both ZX and ZY. Importantly, since both latent spaces are taken from pretrained unimodal encoders, we should expect linear interpolations to be more semantically meaningful than when carried out on ambient space, as is typically done in mixup [44, 87, 106]. We note that this idea of semantic interpolations in latent space is reminiscent of latent space arithmetic that has a well-established history [24, 27, 59, 66]. However, na¨ıvely mixing random samples in each latent space would only produce augmented pairs of latents (˜zx, ˜zy) ∈ZX × ZY where ˜zx and ˜zy are unrelated to one another. Therefore, we want to impose some structure on how interpolations are performed across modalities to ensure that we can construct semantically meaningful augmented pairs. To achieve this we take any two existing positive multimodal pairs (zx, zy) ≜ (gX (x), gY (y)) and i.i.d. (ˆzx, ˆzy) ≜ (gX (ˆx), gY (ˆy)), where (x, y), (ˆx, ˆy) ∼ pX,Y, and construct a corresponding augmentation (˜zx, ˜zy) as λ (zx, zy) + (1 − λ) (ˆzx, ˆzy), where λ (0, 1) is the shared interpolation coefficient. ∇

Location: Section 7. Conclusion and Future Work
Type: Limitation
Quote: In this work, we have proposed a framework for multimodal fusion that is both compute-efficient and data-efficient which can effectively bootstrap from arbitrary pre-trained unimodal encoders. We have introduced FuseMix, a simple yet effective multimodal augmentation scheme on latent space inspired by mixup. However, while our method can benefit from powerful unimodal encoders, we are limited by the semantic information that they have previously learned [39].

Claim 4:
Statement: The proposed framework can be used to repurpose an existing text-to-image generative model to be conditioned on audio in lieu of text.
Location: Section 6.4. Audio-to-Image Generation
Type: Application
Quote: We consider the recently proposed task [27] of generating images given audio prompts. The aim is to repurpose an existing text-to-image generative model to be conditioned on audio in lieu of text. Girdhar et al. [27] achieved this using a private reimplementation of DALLE-2 [69]. We opt to use FuseMix to perform this task while only using publicly available models: we use GLIDE[5] [62], a text-conditioned diffusion model which leverages CLIP[6] [67] to condition on text. We apply our method to align the latent space of Whisper into the latent space of CLIP to endow GLIDE with audio-conditioning capabilities (see supp. material).

Claim 5:
Statement: The quality of the underlying dataset has a strong effect on downstream performance, and sourcing image-text pairs that are maximally diverse provides substantial improvements.
Location: Section 6.3. Evaluating Dataset Efficiency
Type: Finding
Quote: Our results are shown in Figure 3. We observe that increased quantity of data improves performance in lower data regimes as expected (Figure 3a). However, the quality of the underlying dataset also has a very strong effect, as has been similarly observed in other work [47, 88]. In fact, in Figure 3b, we find that 6 the number of image-text pairs × from the web are required to match the performance of using higher quality human-annotated pairs. Interestingly, in Figure 3c we find that with access to limited data, sourcing image-text pairs that are maximally diverse provides substantial improvements of up to nearly 40% compared to sourcing uniform numbers of pairs to measure the effect of quantity on downstream performance.

Evidence:
- In Figure 3b, we find that 6 the number of image-text pairs from the web are required to match the performance of using higher quality human-annotated pairs.
