Claim 2:
Statement: The authors identify four prediction scenarios that are fundamentally different and of differing reliability: exact fact recall, heuristics recall, guesswork, and generic language modeling.
Location: Section 5
Type: Theoretical contribution
Quote: We identify four prediction scenarios that are fundamentally different and of differing reliability. These are exact fact recall, heuristics recall, guesswork, and generic language modeling.

Claim 3:
Statement: The authors find that different prediction scenarios yield distinct CT results if studied in isolation, but CT results are not representative of the dataset as a whole if it contains examples of different prediction scenarios.
Location: Section 4.2
Type: Empirical finding
Quote: Consequently, CT results are not representative of the dataset as a whole if it contains examples of different prediction scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of studying different prediction scenarios in isolation and provide a method for doing this.

Evidence:
- Figure 3: CT results for PRISM GPT-2 XL data. 1000 samples for each scenario in isolation. As well as 1000 combined samples (330 exact fact recall, 340 heuristics recall, 330 guesswork).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: Only provides results for GPT-2 XL

Claim 4:
Statement: The authors' analysis of the CounterFact dataset reveals samples likely to correspond to heuristics recall, and a significant number of samples with low popularity scores, indicating potential issues with the dataset.
Location: Appendix F
Type: Empirical finding
Quote: We find a total of 510 samples that may correspond to heuristics recall, of which 335 samples correspond to prompt bias, 155 to name bias and 20 to both name and prompt bias.

Evidence:
