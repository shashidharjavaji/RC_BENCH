=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: The proposed JMRI framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets for visual grounding.
Location: Section V. CONCLUSION
Type: Novel finding, improvement, or advancement
Quote: In this article, we present JMRI, a novel visual grounding approach by combining early joint representation and deep cross-modal interaction. We propose to use the large-scale vision-language foundation model for early alignment and transformer for deep fusion to establish multi-modal correspondence, resulting in high-quality language-aware visual representations for localization reasoning. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against the state-of-the-arts.
