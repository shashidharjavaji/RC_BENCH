  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 1
  Limitations: Lack of direct comparison with proprietary LLMs
  Quote: However, while the merits of using proprietary LLMs as an evaluation tool are evident, there exist some critical disadvantages: Closed-source Nature, Uncontrolled Versioning, and Prohibitive Costs.

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.1
  Limitations: Limited to 45 customized score rubrics
  Quote: Correlation with Human Scoring We first compare the correlation between human annotators and our baselines using 45 instances each with an unique customized score rubric... PROMETHEUS is on par with GPT-4 across all the three evaluation datasets, where PROMETHEUS obtains a 0.897 Pearson correlation, GPT-4 obtains 0.882, and GPT-3.5-Turbo obtains 0.392.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific to the 45 customized score rubrics used
Confidence: high

Location: Section 5.1
Type: Result
Quote: PROMETHEUS is preferred over GPT-4 in 58.62% of the time, and over GPT-3.5-Turbo in 79.57% of the time, in terms of feedback quality.

Evidence:
- PROMETHEUS is preferred over GPT-4 in 58.62% of the time, and over GPT-3.5-Turbo in 79.57% of the time, in terms of feedback quality.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.1
  Limitations: Limited to pairwise comparison
  Quote: Pairwise Comparison of the Feedback with Human Evaluation To validate the effect of whether PROMETHEUS generates helpful/meaningful feedback in addition to its scoring decision, we ask human annotators to choose a better feedback... PROMETHEUS is preferred over GPT-4 58.62% of the times, and over GPT-3.5-Turbo 79.57% of the times.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific to the pairwise comparison with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo
Confidence: high

- PROMETHEUS shows superior performance on human preference datasets, indicating its possibility as an universal reward model.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 4
  Limitations: Limited to specific human preference datasets
  Quote: In Table 4, results show that prompting LLAMA-2-CHAT surprisingly obtains reasonable performance... When training on feedback derived from coarse-grained score rubrics (denoted as LLAMA2-CHAT 13B + COARSE), it only hurts performance. On the other hand, PROMETHEUS 13B shows a +5.43% and +5.38% margin over its base model LLAMA2-CHAT-13B on the HHH Alignment and MT Bench Human Judgement dataset, respectively.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
