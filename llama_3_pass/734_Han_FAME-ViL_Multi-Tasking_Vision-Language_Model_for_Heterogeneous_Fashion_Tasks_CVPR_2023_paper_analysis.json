    "raw_claims": "Based on the provided research paper, the following claims can be identified:\n\n**Claims:**\n\n1. **Claim ID:** 1\n   - **Claim Text:** FAME-ViL achieves superior performance across a set of diverse fashion tasks with much fewer parameters.\n   - **Location:** Abstract\n   - **Claim Type:** Novel Contribution\n   - **Exact Quote:** \"Specifically, we design a task-versatile architecture on top of a pre-trained generic V+L model (i.e., CLIP [60]). To adapt the simple two-stream architecture of CLIP to various fashion tasks, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Attention Adapter (XAA) to enable the cross-modality interaction between the two streams.\"\n\n2. **Claim ID:** 2\n   - **Claim Text:** FAME-ViL outperforms all prior art fashion models often by a large margin, validating the performance advantages of our method over alternatives in addition to better parameter efficiency.\n   - **Location:** Section 4.1 (Comparisons with prior art methods)\n   - **Claim Type:** Novel Finding\n   - **Exact Quote:** \"Our FAME-ViL outperforms all prior art fashion models often by a large margin, validating the performance advantages of our method over alternatives in addition to better parameter efficiency.\"\n\n3. **Claim ID:** 3\n   - **Claim Text:** The proposed task-versatile architecture with cross-attention adapters and task-specific adapters, and a scalable multi-task training pipeline with multi-teacher distillation, achieves state-of-the-art performance on all tasks.\n   - **Location:** Section 3 (Methodology)\n   - **Claim Type:** Novel Methodology\n   - **Exact Quote:** \"We introduce a novel FAshion-focused Multi-task Efficient learning method for Vision-and-Language tasks (FAME-ViL) in this work. Compared with existing approaches, FAME-ViL applies a single model for multiple heterogeneous fashion tasks, therefore being much more parameter-efficient.\"\n\n4. **Claim ID:** 4\n   - **Claim Text:** The multi-teacher distillation (MTD) training strategy alleviates the negative transfer problem and improves the performance of the multi-task model.\n   - **Location:** Section 4.3 (Ablation study on multi-task training strategy)\n   - **Claim Type:** Novel Contribution\n   - **Exact Quote:** \"Guided by the soft ground truth of each teacher, overfitting can be well avoided in an elegant manner. Considering the methodical orthogonality, we further apply our MTD on top of IAS (L13) and IMTLG (L15).\"\n\n5. **Claim ID:** 5\n   - **Claim Text:** The proposed model architecture with task-specific adapters (TSA) and cross-attention adapters (XAA) is effective in exploiting the inter-task relatedness and improving the performance of the multi-task model.\n   - **Location:** Section 4.2 (Ablation study on architecture)\n   - **Claim Type:** Novel Finding\n   - **Exact Quote:** \"Interestingly, we also found that XAA and TSA are reciprocal: (1) When TSA and XAA work together, the model can achieve better relative performance than the sum of their gains (L4 vs. L2+L3 and L8 vs. L6+L7) (2) When TSA or XAA is applied in isolation, the multi-task model always underperforms its single-task counterpart (L6 vs. L2 and L7 vs. L3).\"",
