Claim 7:
Statement: Salient span masking is crucial for REALM and significantly outperforms other masking strategies.
Location: Section 4.5. Analysis
Type: Novel finding, improvement, or advancement
Quote: While such salient span masking has not been shown to be impactful in previous work with standard BERT training (Joshi et al., 2019), it is crucial for REALM. Intuitively, the latent variable learning relies heavily on the utility of retrieval and is therefore more sensitive to a consistent learning signal.

Evidence:
- Table 2 shows that salient span masking has a significant impact on REALM’s performance, outperforming other masking strategies.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.5
  Limitations: Comparison is based on specific masking strategies
  Quote: REALM with salient span masking 38.5 vs. REALM with random uniform masks 32.3 vs. REALM with random span masks 35.3

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific masking strategy comparison

Claim 8:
Statement: Frequent index refreshes are important for stable optimization in REALM.
Location: Section 4.5. Analysis
Type: Novel finding, improvement, or advancement
Quote: The results in Table 2 suggests that a stale index can hurt model training, and further reducing this staleness could offer better optimization.

Evidence:
- Table 2 shows that frequent index refreshes are important for stable optimization in REALM, with a slower refresh rate (30× stale MIPS) resulting in lower performance (28.7).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.5
  Limitations: Comparison is based on specific refresh rates
  Quote: 30× stale MIPS 28.7 vs. standard REALM

Conclusion:
Justified: True
