Location: Section 6.3: On the Benefits of the Hierarchical Transformer Architecture
Type: Novel finding, improvement, or advancement
Quote: Regarding the embeddings used, the results of an ablation study on the different embeddings used by HTSL and HTML approaches used in this work are presented in Table 3. As might be expected, WWM-BERT has a beneficial effect on each prediction task compared to Glove; although adding audio features to the Glove embeddings offers similar performance benefits.
