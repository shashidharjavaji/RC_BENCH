Claim 3:
Statement: Chain-of-thought prompting is more helpful for tasks that are challenging and require multi-step reasoning, use a large language model, and have a relatively flat scaling curve.
Location: Section A.3
Type: Novel finding, improvement, or advancement
Quote: While chain-of-thought prompting is in principle applicable for any text-to-text task, it is more helpful for some tasks than others. Based on the experiments in this paper, our intuition is that chain of thought helps the most when three conditions are met: (1) the task is challenging and requires multi-step reasoning, (2) a large language model is used, and (3) the scaling curve is relatively flat.

Evidence:
- The performance gain from chain-of-thought prompting is largest for PaLM 540B on GSM8K (challenging multi-step problems, flat scaling curve).
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section A.3
  Limitations: Specific to arithmetic reasoning tasks
  Quote: The performance gain from chain-of-thought prompting is largest for PaLM 540B on GSM8K...

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Requires further empirical evaluation for diverse tasks and language models
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: Prompting with the equation only as an intermediate step is not enough for some arithmetic reasoning datasets due to semantic challenges.
Location: Section A.4
Type: Novel finding, improvement, or advancement
Quote: Prompting with the equation only as an intermediate step does help on many datasets, especially when the datasets only require a few reasoning steps (SVAMP, ASDiv, MAWPS). For GSM8K, however, using the equation only did not improve performance substantially.

Evidence:
- Example from LaMDA 137B: QUESTION: Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points. How many total points did he score?
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section A.4
  Limitations: Specific to GSM8K dataset
  Quote: QUESTION: Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes...

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific to certain arithmetic reasoning datasets
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: Increasing model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting, likely due to emergent abilities such as semantic understanding, symbol mapping, staying on topic, arithmetic ability, faithfulness, etc.
Location: Section A.1
Type: Novel finding, improvement, or advancement
Quote: The finding that successful chain-of-thought reasoning predictably emerges only at certain model scales is intriguing. Scaling up language models has been shown to confer benefits such as improved performance and sample efficiency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent in the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale models, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.

Evidence:
- Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect. Scaling PaLM to 540B fixed a substantial portion of errors in all categories.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section A.1
  Limitations: Specific to PaLM model
  Quote: Error analysis of 45 problems...

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Emergent abilities are not fully understood and require further investigation
Confidence: medium
