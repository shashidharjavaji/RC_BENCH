=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: Dynamic multimodal fusion (DynMM) can reduce computation costs by 46.5% with only a negligible accuracy loss (CMU-MOSEI sentiment analysis)
Location: Section 4.3. Sentiment Analysis
Type: Quantitative Result
Quote: DynMM-a can reduce computations by 46.5% with a slightly decreased accuracy (i.e., -0.47%).

Evidence:
- DynMM-a can reduce computations by 46.5% with a slightly decreased accuracy (i.e., -0.47%) compared to the best performing static network (i.e., Late Fusion)
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3. Sentiment Analysis, Table 2
  Limitations: specific to CMU-MOSEI sentiment analysis
  Quote: DynMM-a 79.07 0.62 165.5

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific to CMU-MOSEI sentiment analysis task
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: DynMM can improve segmentation performance with over 21% savings in computation (NYU Depth V2 semantic segmentation)
Location: Section 4.4. Semantic Segmentation
Type: Quantitative Result
Quote: DynMM-b achieves a mIoU improvement of 0.7% and 21.1% reduction in MAdds at the same time,

Evidence:
- DynMM-b achieves a mIoU improvement of 0.7% and 21.1% reduction in MAdds at the same time, thus demonstrating the superiority of DynMM over static fusion
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4. Semantic Segmentation, Table 3
  Limitations: specific to NYU Depth V2 semantic segmentation
  Quote: DynMM-b 51.0 19.5 21.1%

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific to NYU Depth V2 semantic segmentation task
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: DynMM is more robust to noisy multimodal data compared to the static ESANet
Location: Section 4.4. Semantic Segmentation
Type: Comparative Result
Quote: While ESANet generates reasonable predictions in the normal setting, its performance becomes significantly worse when multimodal data is perturbed by noise. On the contrary, our DynMM is robust to noise and provides a good prediction for both scenarios.

Evidence:
- DynMM is more robust to noise and provides a good prediction for both scenarios, while ESANet generates reasonable predictions in the normal setting but becomes significantly worse when multimodal data is perturbed by noise
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4. Semantic Segmentation, Figure 6 and Figure 7
  Limitations: specific to NYU Depth V2 semantic segmentation with injected noise
  Quote: DynMM is more robust to noise and provides a good prediction for both scenarios...

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific to comparison with ESANet and limited to NYU Depth V2 dataset
Confidence: high
