Claim 1:
Statement: Using a Panel of LLM Evaluators (PoLL) composed of smaller models is an effective method for evaluating LLM performance, reducing intra-model bias, latency, and cost.
Location: Section 5 Conclusions and Limitations
Type: Methodological contribution
Quote: In this paper, we showed how a Panel of LLM Evaluators composed of smaller models is not only an effective method for evaluating LLM performance, but also reduces intra-model bias, latency, and cost.

Evidence:
- Across three distinct judge settings and spanning six different datasets, we find that using a PoLL composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: Limited to three judge settings and six datasets
  Quote: Across three distinct judge settings and spanning six different datasets, we find that using a PoLL composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.

- The cost of running our specific instance of PoLL is $1.25/input + $4.25/output, whereas the cost of running GPT-4 Turbo is $10/input + $30/output.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.5
  Limitations: Cost comparison is based on specific instances of PoLL and GPT-4 Turbo
  Quote: At the time of writing, the cost of running our specific instance of PoLL is $1.25/input + $4.25/output, whereas the cost of running GPT-4 Turbo is $10/input + $30/output.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Specific cost comparison might not be universally applicable; PoLL's effectiveness might vary across different tasks and domains
Confidence: high

Claim 2:
Statement: PoLL outperforms a single large judge in evaluating LLM generations, exhibiting less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.
Location: Abstract
Type: Comparative evaluation
Quote: We propose instead to evaluate models using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL) drawn from different model families rather than a single large judge, and find that using an instantiation of PoLL correlates better with human judgements compared to a single large judge (GPT-4), while being over seven times cheaper.

Evidence:
- PoLL outperforms a single large judge in evaluating LLM generations, exhibiting less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: Limited to three judge settings and six datasets
  Quote: PoLL outperforms a single large judge in evaluating LLM generations, exhibiting less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Same as Claim 1; Additionally, the claim assumes a specific composition of PoLL
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 3:
Statement: GPT-4 is a relatively weak judge, exhibiting high variance with minor changes to the prompt.
Location: Section 4.3
Type: Methodological limitation
Quote: In some scenarios, GPT-4 is a relatively weak judge, exhibiting high variance with minor changes to the prompt.

Evidence:
- Based on the observation that GPT-4 was the weakest judge model on our KILT evaluations, we investigated how the model reacts to modifications to its prompt.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Limited to KILT evaluations and GPT-4
  Quote: Based on the observation that GPT-4 was the weakest judge model on our KILT evaluations, we investigated how the model reacts to modifications to its prompt.

- In Table 3, we can see how the correlation between GPT-4 and human annotators varies as the prompt changes.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: Limited to KILT evaluations and GPT-4
  Quote: In Table 3, we can see how the correlation between GPT-4 and human annotators varies as the prompt changes.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: medium
Limitations: Limited to a specific experiment with GPT-4; Prompt changes might not universally impact GPT-4's performance
Confidence: medium

==================================================

Claim 4:
Statement: Intra-model scoring bias is reduced by pooling judgements across a panel of heterogeneous evaluator models.
Location: Section 4.4
Type: Methodological contribution
Quote: One of the biggest motivators for replacing a single large judge with a panel of heterogeneous models is to reduce bias in evaluation, and we find that overall, PoLL has the smallest spread in scores.

Evidence:
- One of the biggest motivators for replacing a single large judge with a panel of heterogeneous models is to reduce bias in evaluation.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5 Conclusions and Limitations
  Limitations: Limited to the context of the paper
  Quote: One of the biggest motivators for replacing a single large judge with a panel of heterogeneous models is to reduce bias in evaluation.

- In Figures 3 and 4, we can see how the different judges score different models and how far those predictions deviate from human annotator decisions.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4
  Limitations: Limited to multi-hop datasets
  Quote: In Figures 3 and 4, we can see how the different judges score different models and how far those predictions deviate from human annotator decisions.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: Assumes a specific context of evaluation; Might not generalize to all scenarios where bias is a concern
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 5:
Statement: PoLL performs well consistently across different tasks, but further work is needed to see how broadly applicable the method is.
Location: Section 5 Conclusions and Limitations
Type: Future work direction
Quote: In this work we investigated only three evaluator settings and a limited number of judges and panel compositions, while PoLL performs well consistently, further work is needed to see how broadly applicable the method is.

Evidence:
- While we showed that PoLL is an effective alternative to a single large model in these settings, further work is needed to see how broadly applicable the method is.
  Strength: weak
  Location: Section 5 Conclusions and Limitations
  Limitations: Acknowledged as a limitation of the study
  Quote: While we showed that PoLL is an effective alternative to a single large model in these settings, further work is needed to see how broadly applicable the method is.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: low
Limitations: Acknowledges the need for further research; Lack of concrete evidence within the provided text to support the claim
Confidence: low
