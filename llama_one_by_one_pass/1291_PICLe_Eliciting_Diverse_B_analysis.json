Moreover, PICLe demonstrates generally high confidence and low uncertainty in its responses, especially when applied to Llama-2. Also see Appendix F for experiment on a bigger Llama-2 model. PICLe helps non-RLHF models. We verify the performance of PICLe on the non-RLHF models, Vicuna and GPT-J. In particular, without ICL, GPT-J completely fails to follow instructions of responding \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019, making it impossible to report any meaningful performances. Vicuna, on the other hand, consistently outputs the same response across different statements, with high confidence. This behavior accounts for Vicuna\u2019s Action Consistency of around 50% with near-zero standard deviations. We conjecture that GPT-J and Vicuna being non-RLHF base models contributes to these phenomena. However, when ICL-based methods are applied, these models too show signs of persona elicitation, with significantly increased action consistency values. Notably, PICLe improves the performance from 50.1% (base) to 78.6%, with only three in-context examples."
