Claim 4:
Statement: PICLe helps non-RLHF models, improving performance from 50.1% (base) to 78.6% with only three in-context examples.
Location: Section 4.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 1: Persona elicitation results. Three context examples were used for the ICL baselines. ‘(Action) Consistency’ and ’Action Confidence (Conf)’ are in percentage. ‘Uncert’ refers to the action-level Uncertainty, and ‘Tok Uncert’ refers to token-level Uncertainty. Best Action Consistency values are in bold.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: PICLe consistently outperforms all baselines on three LLMs with respect to Action Consistency. While baselines have no consensus on which approach works best in all three models, our PICLe achieves the highest Action Consistency overall. On Llama-2, PICLe achieves an average action consistency of 88.1%, outperforming the current strongest baseline similarity (84.6%) using the same number of in-context examples (K = 3). Moreover, PICLe demonstrates generally high confidence and low uncertainty in its responses, especially when applied to Llama-2. Also see Appendix F for experiment on a bigger Llama-2 model. PICLe helps non-RLHF models. We verify the performance of PICLe on the non-RLHF models, Vicuna and GPT-J. In particular, without ICL, GPT-J completely fails to follow instructions of responding ‘yes’ or ‘no’, making it impossible to report any meaningful performances. Vicuna, on the other hand, consistently outputs the same response across different statements, with high confidence. This behavior accounts for Vicuna’s Action Consistency of around 50% with near-zero standard deviations. We conjecture that GPT-J and Vicuna being non-RLHF base models contributes to these phenomena. However, when ICL-based methods are applied, these models too show signs of persona elicitation, with significantly increased action consistency values. Notably, PICLe improves the performance from 50.1% (base) to 78.6%, with only three in-context examples.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: PICLe improves the performance of non-RLHF models, specifically Vicuna and GPT-J, by leveraging in-context learning (ICL) to elicit diverse personas. The results show a significant improvement in Action Consistency, from 50.1% (base) to 78.6% with only three in-context examples.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a comprehensive evaluation of PICLe across multiple models (Vicuna and GPT-J) and metrics (Action Consistency, Action Confidence, Uncertainty, and Token Uncertainty). The results consistently show PICLe outperforming the base model, indicating a reliable improvement.
  Limitations: The evaluation is limited to three in-context examples, and the generalizability of the results to other non-RLHF models and persona types is not explicitly explored.

Claim 5:
Statement: Refining the selection pool improves ICL performance significantly, as shown in Table 2.
Location: Section 4.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 2 shows that refining the selection pool to only include positive-labeled statements that align with the persona significantly improves the performance of all ICL methods, including PICLe, on Llama-2. For instance, the Action Consistency of the Similarity-based ICL improves from 84.6% to 92.4%.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: The experiment is limited to Llama-2 and may not generalize to other models or datasets.
  Exact Quote: Refining the selection pool improves ICL performance significantly. In Table 2, we observe that this selection pool refinement significantly improves the performance of all ICL methods, when evaluated on Llama-2. For instance, the Action Consistency of the Similarity-based ICL improves from 84.6% to 92.4%.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Refining the selection pool improves ICL performance significantly, as shown in Table 2.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it consistently shows improvement across all ICL methods, with a notable increase in Action Consistency for PICLe.

Claim 8:
Statement: PICLe is not sensitive to the number of epochs used for Persona SFT, as shown in Table 6.
Location: Section 5.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 6 shows that the performance of PICLe does not change significantly with different number of epochs, with the highest performance at 88.7% for 3 epochs and the lowest at 87.6% for 1 epoch, indicating that PICLe is not sensitive to the number of epochs used for Persona SFT.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: PICLe is not sensitive to the number of epochs used for Persona SFT. In Table 6, we reveal how the persona elicitation performances change as the number of Persona SFT epochs is tuned.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: PICLe is not sensitive to the number of epochs used for Persona SFT, as shown in Table 6.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a comprehensive evaluation across multiple epochs, providing a clear trend of consistent performance. However, the analysis could be further strengthened by exploring more extreme epoch values or evaluating the model's sensitivity in different contexts.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific experimental setup and may not generalize to other models or scenarios. Additionally, the conclusion is based on a relatively small variation in performance, which might not be significant in all contexts.

  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from multiple experiments with different persona combinations. However, the number of experiments is limited to four cases, which might not be representative of all possible persona combinations.
  Limitations: The experiments are limited to four specific persona combinations, and the generalizability of the results to other combinations is unknown. Additionally, the evaluation metric used is action consistency, which might not capture all aspects of persona elicitation.
  Location: Section H

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 12:
Statement: Using the Persona SFT model as the query LLM slightly improves performance for some baselines, but PICLe remains the best performing method with 88.3 action consistency.
Location: Section I

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 16 reports how performance changes as we change the original query LLM to the persona SFT model (denoted ‘PSFT’), for the major baselines ‘Base’, ‘Random‘, and ‘Similarity’. While ‘Base’ does not show much difference, all other baseline performances slightly improved. This was also the case with PICLe, while remaining as the best performing method with 88.3 action consistency.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 7, Table 16
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: While ‘Base’ does not show much difference, all other baseline performances slightly improved. This was also the case with PICLe, while remaining as the best performing method with 88.3 action consistency.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Using the Persona SFT model as the query LLM slightly improves performance for some baselines, but PICLe remains the best performing method with 88.3 action consistency.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from Table 16, which systematically compares the performance of different baselines with and without the Persona SFT model. However, the generalizability of these findings to other models or scenarios might be limited.
  Limitations: The analysis is confined to the specific baselines and models tested. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of using the Persona SFT model for querying across a broader range of scenarios.
