Claim 6:
Statement: The ablation study confirms that using hallucinative captions as hard negative samples in contrastive learning is effective in reducing hallucinations and improving model performance.
Location: Section 4.4

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 5: The result of ablations for the impact of hallucinative captions. We report the text-dev score results of POPE[27], MMhalBench [44], VQA and MME. w/ CL refers to training MLLMs with Contrastive Learning for MLLMs, w/ HC refers to utilize hallucinative captions to enhance the contrastive learning.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4. Ablation Study
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Absent the facilitation from hallucinative captions, the models displayed moderate improvements on hallucination benchmarks such as MMhal-Bench, yet these improvements were somewhat constrained. However, the subsequent inclusion of hallucinative captions resulted in a marked enhancement on the same hallucination benchmark, thus affirming the potency of the hallucinative captions.

- Evidence Text: Figure 4: This figure illustrates the visualization of various data distributions. The blue icons represent visual data extracted from images, the green icons denote ground truth caption data, and the red icons signify hallucinative caption data. The label "w/o HACL" represents the data distribution obtained from the original model output without employing our proposed method. On the other hand, "w/ CL" indicates the data distribution resulting from the model output utilizing contrastive learning. Lastly, "w/ HACL" indicates the data distribution generated by the model output using our proposed method.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.5. Visualization
  Limitations: Visualization might not directly prove the effectiveness of hallucinative captions
  Exact Quote: Not only did the modal gap decrease, but the hallucination sample distribution was also significantly distanced.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The ablation study confirms that using hallucinative captions as hard negative samples in contrastive learning is effective in reducing hallucinations and improving model performance.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from multiple benchmarks, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the approach's effectiveness. The use of both quantitative (Table 5) and qualitative (Figure 4) evidence strengthens the conclusion.
  Limitations: The study's focus on a specific set of benchmarks might limit the generalizability of the findings to other multimodal tasks or models. Further research could explore the applicability of this approach across a broader range of scenarios.
