Claim 3:
Statement: The authors propose a simple yet effective defense strategy against hallucination attacks, using entropy threshold defense.
Location: Section 4.2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The results of entropy threshold defense are demonstrated in Fig. 4(b). Where the horizontal axis represents different entropy thresholds, and the vertical axis represents recall (how many prompts will not be refused). It can be observed that when the entropy threshold is set to 1.6, all raw prompts can be answered normally, while 46.1% OoD prompts and 61.5% weak semantic prompts will be refused by the LLMs.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: The results of entropy threshold defense are demonstrated in Fig. 4(b).

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors propose a simple yet effective defense strategy against hallucination attacks, using entropy threshold defense.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on experimental results that demonstrate the defense strategy's effectiveness across different entropy thresholds.
  Limitations: The study's limitations include the reliance on a single defense strategy and the potential for over-refusal of the entropy threshold, which may lead to false negatives.
  Location: Section 4.2

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 4:
Statement: The authors find that the success rate of triggering hallucinations is high for both weak semantic and OoD attacks, with Vicuna-7B achieving a 92.31% success rate for weak semantic attacks.
Location: Section 4.1

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 1: The success rate of triggering hallucinations on Vicuna-7B and LLaMA2-7B-chat models with weak semantic and OoD attacks.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Methods Vicuna LLaMA2 Weak Semantic Attack 92.31% 53.85% OoD Attack 80.77% 30.77%

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: No conclusion available
  Conclusion Justified: No
  Robustness: N/A
  Limitations: N/A

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 5:
Statement: The authors observe that the longer the initialization length of OoD prompts, the higher the success rate of triggering hallucinations, with a significant increase of 34.6% when the length increases from 20 to 30.
Location: Section 4.1

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 4 demonstrates the success rate of triggering hallucinations on the LLaMA2-7B-chat model initialized with different lengths of OoD prompts.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Table 4: The success rate of triggering hallucinations on the LLaMA2-7B-chat model initialized with different lengths of OoD prompts.

- Evidence Text: The results show that when the length of the OoD prompts increases from 20 to 30, the attack success rate significantly increases by 34.6% (30.77% → 65.38%).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: When the length of the OoD prompts increases from 20 to 30, the attack success rate significantly increases by 34.6% (30.77% → 65.38%).

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors observe a positive correlation between the length of OoD prompts and the success rate of triggering hallucinations, with a notable increase when the length increases from 20 to 30.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on empirical results from experiments with different lengths of OoD prompts. However, the sample size and the specific models used (LLaMA2-7B-chat) might limit the generalizability of the findings.
  Limitations: The study only examines the effect of OoD prompt length on two specific models (LLaMA2-7B-chat) and might not be representative of all LLMs. Additionally, the experiment only tests lengths up to 30, leaving the behavior for longer prompts unknown.
  Location: Section 4.1

Claim 6:
Statement: The authors conclude that hallucinations could be a fundamental feature of LLMs beyond training data, and that this understanding could lead to a reevaluation of how to comprehensively evaluate LLMs.
Location: Section 6

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors conduct extensive experiments revealing that hallucinations could be another view of adversarial examples, it’s more beyond training data.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 6, Conclusion
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We conduct extensive experiments revealing that hallucinations could be another view of adversarial examples, it’s more beyond training data.

- Evidence Text: The authors propose a simple yet effective way to defense those adversarial prompts without additional adversarial training.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.2, Study on Threshold Defense
  Limitations: Limited to defense strategies
  Exact Quote: In long term run, we believe this novel understanding of hallucination would lead the community rethink how to comprehensively evaluate our LLMs.
