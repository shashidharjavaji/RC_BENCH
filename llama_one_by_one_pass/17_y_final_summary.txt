Claim 3:
Statement: The addition of tabular information extracted from company filing data to verbal-vocal cues shows a gain of 10-12% across different settings.
Location: Section 4.1

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 5 shows ablation across different modalities observed for the SOTA M3A model applied to both datasets to understand the impact of varying modalities and their correlations. Unimodal settings severely underperform across both tasks. The addition of tabular information extracted from company filing data to verbal-vocal cues shows a gain of 10-12% across different settings.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Interestingly, utilizing text transcripts with table data from financial documents instead of its audio counterpart does not deteriorate the model performance (Table 5, highlighted in green). This has important implications for proposing company filing as an alternative to the audio input as vocal cues are noisy and processing-heavy.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The addition of tabular information extracted from company filing data to verbal-vocal cues shows a gain of 10-12% across different settings.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from experiments conducted on two datasets (MAEC and M&A) using a state-of-the-art model (M3A). The results are consistent across different tasks (volatility prediction and price movement prediction) and intervals (3, 7, and 15 days).
  Limitations: The study's generalizability to other domains or languages is not explored. The datasets used are specific to the financial domain and English language.

Claim 4:
Statement: Utilizing tabular information as an alternative to audio input for multimodal financial prediction tasks can reduce gender bias.
Location: Section 4.2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 6 shows that the table modality has the least error disparity. Audio modality has consistently higher error individually as well as in combination with either of the other modalities, while it significantly drops when considering just text and table data.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1 Bias Reduction through Company Filings
  Limitations: None mentioned in the paper
  Exact Quote: We observe that the table modality has the least error disparity. Audio modality has consistently higher error individually as well as in combination with either of the other modalities, while it significantly drops when considering just text and table data.

- Evidence Text: The primary reason for the observation tends to be the imbalance in the male and female distribution in speakers of earnings calls. In our case, since female examples are very less in comparison to the male counterparts (only 7% in earnings calls and 12% in M&A calls identify as females), the model discriminates between male and female examples by inferring insufficient information beyond its source and learns imperfect generalizations between the attributes and labels.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.1 Bias Reduction through Company Filings
  Limitations: Specific to the datasets used in the study
  Exact Quote: The primary reason for the observation tends to be the imbalance in the male and female distribution in speakers of earnings calls.

Conclusion:

Claim 8:
Statement: Replacing audio clips with tabular data from company filings leads to a reduction of data processing time and data storage requirements by over 90% and 50%, respectively.
Location: Section 4.2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: While audio input modality certainly improves model performance, it adds unintended model bias due to the differences in acoustic features for males and females. Audio clips require processing-heavy algorithms such as forced alignment to extract meaningful features from linguistic and acoustic utterances as opposed to semi-structured information in tables that can be utilized with minimal processing. Replacing audio clips with tabular data from company filings leads to a reduction of data processing time and data storage requirements by over 90% and 50%, respectively.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: None mentioned in the text

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: Replacing audio clips with tabular data from company filings leads to a significant reduction in data processing time and data storage requirements.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it provides a clear comparison between the processing requirements of audio clips and tabular data, demonstrating a substantial reduction in processing time and storage needs when using tabular data.
  Limitations: The claim does not provide specific details on the exact reduction percentages for all possible scenarios, and the generalization might not hold for all types of audio and tabular data.
