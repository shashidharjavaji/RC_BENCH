Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The proposed method achieves the best performance across all metrics in both GPT2 and Llama.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a comprehensive comparison with multiple attribution methods across two different models (GPT2 and Llama), providing a strong indication of the proposed method's effectiveness.
  Limitations: The evaluation is limited to the specific metrics (MRR, prob, and logp) and models (GPT2 and Llama) used in the study. Further research could explore additional metrics and models to reinforce the conclusion.

Claim 2:
Statement: The log probability increase method can identify important neurons in both medium-deep layers and very deep layers.
Location: Section 4.1

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The curve of log probability increase exhibits an approximately linear shape from 0 to 40 segments, while the curve of probability increase shows a linear trend from 40 to 60 segments. This observation elucidates the findings in Figure 2: employing probability increase is more inclined to attribute neurons in the deepest layers, whereas log probability increase tends to attribute neurons in medium-deep layers. Despite the slower slope of the log probability increase curve in very deep layers, it still effectively attributes neurons in very deep layers (as depicted in Figure 2).
  Strength: strong

Claim 3:
Statement: The shallow and medium FFN neurons are important for activating the attention "value neurons".
Location: Section 4.2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The medium-deep attention layers play large rules. Compared Figure 6-7 with Figure 4-5, we find that several attention "query layers" also contribute to final predictions (e.g. a19, a22, a26 in GPT2 and a16, a18, a19, a21 in Llama for country/capital/language).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: None

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: When intervening top1000 shallow neurons for each sentence, both MRR and probability drops very much (92%/95% in GPT2 and 87%/95% in Llama).

In both models, the number of query-only neurons, which is much larger than that of query-value neurons, starts to drop at 60% layer.
