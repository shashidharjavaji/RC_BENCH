Statement: LLMs cannot plan themselves but can play a variety of constructive roles in solving planning tasks–especially as approximate knowledge sources and candidate plan generators in the so-called LLM-Modulo Frameworks in conjunction with external sound model-based verifiers.
Location: Abstract

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The paper presents a position that LLMs cannot plan themselves but can play a variety of constructive roles in solving planning tasks, especially as approximate knowledge sources and candidate plan generators in the so-called LLM-Modulo Frameworks in conjunction with external sound model-based verifiers.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Abstract
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We argue that auto-regressive LLMs cannot, by themselves, do planning or self-verification (which is after all a form of reasoning), and shed some light on the reasons for misunderstandings in the literature.

- Evidence Text: The paper discusses the limitations of LLMs in planning tasks, highlighting that they cannot generate executable plans in autonomous mode and cannot verify plans, thus cannot improve by self-critiquing.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: LLMs cannot generate executable plans in autonomous mode... LLMs cannot verify plans and thus cannot improve by self-critiquing.

- Evidence Text: The paper proposes the LLM-Modulo Framework, which leverages the strengths of LLMs with external model-based verifiers in a tighter bi-directional interaction regime, allowing LLMs to play multiple roles in planning, including generating candidate plans, converting plans into specialized representations, and helping end-users refine incomplete problem specifications.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We propose a general “LLM-Modulo” framework... While we believe that versions of such an architecture can be of use in a wide variety of planning or reasoning tasks, for the sake of concreteness, we will focus on planning tasks, especially of the type studied in the automated planning community.

- Evidence Text: The paper presents case studies of the LLM-Modulo Framework, including classical planning domains and a recent travel planning benchmark, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in improving LLM performance in planning tasks.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: Limited to specific domains and benchmarks
  Exact Quote: We have applied the LLM-Modulo framework to classical planning domains... and to a recent travel planning benchmark.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: LLMs cannot plan themselves but can play a variety of constructive roles in solving planning tasks–especially as approximate knowledge sources and candidate plan generators in the so-called LLM-Modulo Frameworks in conjunction with external sound model-based verifiers.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a combination of theoretical analysis, experimental results, and case studies. The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the LLM-Modulo Framework, including its strengths and limitations.
  Limitations: The paper's focus on text-based LLMs and planning tasks might limit the generalizability of the findings to other types of LLMs or tasks. Additionally, the paper's reliance on external model-based verifiers might not be feasible in all scenarios, particularly in situations where such verifiers are not available or are too complex to implement.

Claim 2:
Statement: The LLM-Modulo framework is a Generate-Test-Critique loop, with the LLM generating candidate plans and a bank of critics critiquing the candidate.
Location: Section 3

Evidence:
  None
Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The LLM-Modulo framework is a Generate-Test-Critique loop, with the LLM generating candidate plans and a bank of critics critiquing the candidate.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes

Claim 3:
Statement: The LLM-Modulo framework puts no priori constraints on the expressiveness of the problems that can be posed to the planner.
Location: Section 3.5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The LLM-Modulo framework is more representative of real-world planning problems such as those in NASA mission planning, where the different critics–human and automated–are at best able to give “no objection” certificates for the candidate plans under consideration, clearing it from their perspective.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.5
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Generalizing planning and reasoning frameworks this way is consistent with the Doyle & Patil’s call to the Knowledge Representation community of yore, as well as our own call for model-lite planning (Kambhampati, 2007). Note that this is starkly different from just sending an unvetted plan out to execution (as would be the case if we have LLMs operate in autonomous mode to guess plans).

  Location: Section 4

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 12:
Statement: The LLM-Modulo framework is applicable to other scenarios involving planning and reasoning, such as Reinforcement Learning with Simulators.
Location: Section 5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The fact that simulators play the role of verifiers is often not explicitly recognized in cases where LLMs are used as an actor to generate an admissible plan by interacting with a simulator, for example in the case of AlfWorld (Yao et al., 2023b; Shinn et al., 2023).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Similar to extracting a domain model such as in the case of (Guan et al., 2023), LLMs can also be used for designing a reward model or shaping the reward (Bhambri et al., 2024; Kwon et al., 2022; Hao et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023).

- Evidence Text: The LLM-Modulo framework's ability to leverage LLMs for robust planning is equally applicable to other scenarios involving planning and reasoning, such as Reinforcement Learning with Simulators.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: Assumes the framework's robust planning capabilities are transferable to other domains
  Exact Quote: RL systems rely on rewards as feed-back to train a policy. Simulators takes on the roles of plan evaluation and critiques performed by the respective critics in the LLM-Modulo framework (e.g. (Rajvanshi et al., 2023)).

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The LLM-Modulo framework is applicable to other scenarios involving planning and reasoning, such as Reinforcement Learning with Simulators.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is moderately robust, as it relies on the analogy between the LLM-Modulo framework's application in AlfWorld and its potential application in Reinforcement Learning with Simulators. While this analogy is reasonable, it may not be universally applicable, and further research is needed to fully establish the framework's effectiveness in diverse scenarios.
  Limitations: The evidence does not provide explicit examples or experimental results to support the claim in the context of Reinforcement Learning with Simulators. Additional research is required to fully validate the framework's applicability in this specific domain.
  Location: Section 5

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 13:
Statement: The LLM-Modulo framework can be used in RL systems to leverage LLMs for designing a reward model or shaping the reward.
Location: Section 5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Recent developments in RL have shown that LLMs can be used to design a reward model or shape the reward, leveraging their ability to generate approximate symbolic models.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: None mentioned in the provided text snippet
  Exact Quote: Indeed, LLMs make it easy to get problem-specific knowledge as long as we are willing to relax the correctness requirements of that knowledge.... LLMs can also be used for designing a reward model or shaping the reward (Bhambri et al., 2024; Kwon et al., 2022; Hao et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023).

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The LLM-Modulo framework can be effectively applied in RL systems to design a reward model or shape the reward, leveraging the strengths of LLMs in generating approximate symbolic models.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on recent developments in RL and the demonstrated performance improvements in goal-seeking behaviors. However, the long-term impact and generalizability of LLM-Modulo in RL systems require further research.
  Limitations: The application of LLM-Modulo in RL is limited to scenarios where approximate symbolic models can provide a significant performance boost. Additionally, the framework's effectiveness may be hindered by the complexity of the reward design task or the quality of the LLM used.
  Location: Section 5

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 14:
Statement: The LLM-Modulo framework can be used to filter action choices suggested by the LLM with the help of a simulator in RL-with-Simulator scenarios.
Location: Section 5

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: SayCan (Ahn et al., 2022) the earliest use of LLMs in generating policies in an RL-with-Simulator scenario, explicitly filters the action choices suggested by the LLM with the help of a simulator.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Although we focused on text based LLMs (such as GPT4), recently there have also been impressive development in multi-modal LLMs (e.g. GPT4V). While multi-modality is a great addition that increases the coverage of their System 1 imagination (Figure 1), it is not clear that this gives them System 2 competence. As we discussed earlier, we can leverage VLMs for style criticism of the robot behavior (Guan et al., 2024). Finally, our position (with published supporting evidence) that LLMs are incapable of supporting planning in autonomous modes must seem quite at odds with the current head-long rush into agentic LLMs. We believe that the latter is largely a result of confusing “acting” with “planning.” Given their ability to translate across formalisms, it is of course possible for LLMs to invoke external services– something frameworks like AutoGPT and LangChain support. But the mere ability to invoke an action doesn’t, in any way, guarantee that the course of actions thus invoked will achieve a desired state of affairs. The only way to guarantee the latter is to to support robust planning capabilities– something our LLM-Modulo frameworks strive to do.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The LLM-Modulo framework can be effectively applied to RL-with-Simulator scenarios, enabling the filtering of action choices suggested by the LLM with the help of a simulator, as demonstrated by the SayCan approach.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a specific implementation (SayCan) that demonstrates the feasibility of the LLM-Modulo framework in RL-with-Simulator scenarios. However, the generalizability of this approach across various RL scenarios and LLM architectures may require further investigation.
  Limitations: The conclusion is limited to the specific context of RL-with-Simulator scenarios and may not directly apply to other planning or reasoning tasks. Additionally, the effectiveness of the LLM-Modulo framework in more complex or dynamic environments is not explicitly addressed in the provided evidence.
