It yields several noteworthy observations: Without Safety Strategies: Agents with GPT-4 backbone are the safest agents. GPT-4 achieves an average safety score of 2, categorically interpreted as \u201cPossible Mild Risk\u201d. Other models generally fall into the categories of \u201cLikely Mild Risk\u201d or \u201cPossible Severe Risk,\u201d indicating high risks. In terms of helpfulness, GPT-4 distinguishes itself as the only model to surpass a score of 1, suggesting a level of helpfulness better than \u201cUnsatisfactory\u201d but not \u201cGood\u201d yet. The performances of other models are notably weaker. The least effective models in terms of helpfulness are GPT-3.5 and Claude-instant-1.2, whose performance are \u201cPoor\u201d. Safety Strategies enhance both safety and helpfulness The three safety strategies demonstrate a marked enhancement in safety metric. They also improve helpfulness on medicine, food, and chemistry. The performance of the agent using GPT-4 is both the safest and most helpful, underscoring the necessity of a robust general capability in order for an agent to be considerate and safe under complex scenarios. Notably, the enhancement in safety does not come at the cost of reduced helpfulness, suggesting a synergistic relationship between these two metrics in all domains: safety and helpfulness are not mutually exclusive, on the contrary, ensuring safety is essential for being helpful as unsafe actions are not just unhelpful but may also be harmful. This observation underscores the importance of integrating comprehensive safety measures as an intrinsic part of improving overall agent performance.",
