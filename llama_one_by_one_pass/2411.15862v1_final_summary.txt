=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: LLMs do not think step-by-step in implicit reasoning.
Location: Abstract

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We choose a large model, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (Team, 2024), to perform implicit reasoning, because we find small 7B level models can hardly do a multi-step problem correctly without CoT, while a 70B level model can achieve an accuracy of over 50%. Because the 72B model has 80 layers, to reduce the computing cost, we average the hidden states across every 4 consecutive layers.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.1
  Limitations: None

Claim 4:
Statement: The study investigates the implicit reasoning processes within a large model.
Location: Introduction

Evidence:
  None
Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The study investigates the implicit reasoning processes within a large model, specifically targeting the process of handling multi-step arithmetic problems without resorting to outputting explicit intermediate steps.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a well-defined research question and a clear methodology for investigating implicit reasoning processes. The use of a powerful open-source model (Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) adds to the robustness.
  Limitations: The study's focus on arithmetic problems might limit the generalizability of the findings to other types of reasoning tasks. Additionally, the reliance on a single model, although powerful, might not capture the full spectrum of implicit reasoning behaviors across different models.

Claim 6:
Statement: The model hardly calculates the intermediate results in implicit reasoning.
Location: 2.2 Results of Probing Intermediate Steps

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The results in Figure 2 and Figure 3 shows the accuracy of probing the intermediate result of each step when the problem is 3-step or 5-step. It is clear that the results of the first step and the last step can always be probed successfully in the back layers, indicating the model does memorize the input value (i.e. the result of the first step) and does conceive the final answer (i.e. the result of the last step). By contrast, the result of the second step can barely be probed with a lower accuracy, and the results of other steps in the middle can hardly be detected.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.2
  Limitations: The experiment only tested simple multi-step arithmetic problems with only addition and subtraction.
  Exact Quote: It is clear that the results of the first step and the last step can always be probed successfully in the back layers... By contrast, the result of the second step can barely be probed with a lower accuracy, and the results of other steps in the middle can hardly be detected.

- Evidence Text: This finding indicates that, in generic cases, there is actually not a specific state where the model calculates the results of the intermediate steps, even when it correctly give a answer of the multi-step problem. It actually skips the intermediate steps and come up with the final result directly.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.2
  Limitations: None mentioned
  Exact Quote: This finding indicates that, in generic cases, there is actually not a specific state where the model calculates the results of the intermediate steps...

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The model hardly calculates the intermediate results in implicit reasoning, suggesting it relies on intuition and memory rather than step-by-step reasoning.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from experiments with a large model (Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) and a significant number of samples (2000). However, the robustness could be further enhanced by testing with more diverse problem types and models.
  Limitations: The study focuses on arithmetic problems, which might not fully represent all types of multi-step problems. Additionally, the probing method relies on a simple linear classifier, which might not capture the full complexity of the model's internal workings.

Claim 7:
Statement: LLMs may have the ability to perform a 2-hop reasoning in implicit reasoning, but not at all when there are more steps involved.
Location: 2.2 Results of Probing Intermediate Steps

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The results in Figure 2 and Figure 3 shows the accuracy of probing the intermediate result of each step when the problem is 3-step or 5-step. It is clear that the results of the first step and the last step can always be probed successfully in the back layers, indicating the model does memorize the input value (i.e. the result of the first step) and does conceive the final answer (i.e. the result of the last step). By contrast, the result of the second step can barely be probed with a lower accuracy, and the results of other steps in the middle can hardly be detected.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.2
  Limitations: The study only examined simple multi-step arithmetic problems with only addition and subtraction.
  Exact Quote: This finding indicates that, in generic cases, there is actually not a specific state where the model calculates the results of the intermediate steps, even when it correctly give a answer of the multi-step problem.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: LLMs may have the ability to perform a 2-hop reasoning in implicit reasoning, but not at all when there are more steps involved.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is moderately robust as it is based on empirical results from probing intermediate steps in arithmetic problems. However, the robustness could be improved by testing across a broader range of problem types and sizes.
  Limitations: The study's focus on arithmetic problems might not generalize to all types of multi-step reasoning tasks. Additionally, the probing method's reliance on a linear classifier might not fully capture the complexity of the model's internal reasoning process.
