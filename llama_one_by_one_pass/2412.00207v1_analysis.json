Notably, under the same personality setting, the standard deviation of the human perception scores is smaller than that of the chatbot self-reported score, indicating that human perceived scores show less variation between individuals, while chatbot self-reports exhibit greater variability. What is more interesting is the correlation between human perception scores and chatbot self-reported scores.

Although we sought to minimize this by using personality assessments of different lengths for self-reported data, the human-perceived personality was measured with only one questionnaire due to time constraints. Future research could address this by incorporating a broader range of personality tests and developing assessments specifically tailored for LLMs to achieve more accurate measurements. Second, our findings are based on a single chatbot personality setting method and may not generalize well to others, highlighting the need for further investigation with different approaches. Additionally, the chatbot was designed with a focus on task completion, mirroring real-world applications to ensure ecological validity. As a result, the task settings may have constrained the variability in perceived personality. Moreover, the evaluation was conducted on five common chatbot tasks, which may not capture the full spectrum of user interactions. Expanding the task set in future studies could provide a more comprehensive view of task-based chatbot personality assessment. Third, while our study only focuses on GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024), we expect the same experimental setup could be extended to other LLMs. The extent to which our findings generalize to a broader range of models remains an open question for future research.
