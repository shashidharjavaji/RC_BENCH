Claim 3:
Statement: The model tends to ignore the obfuscated domain context and instead produced actions from the original Blocksworld domain.
Location: Section C.2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The LLM planner had no exposure to the obfuscated domain during training. Our results showed that achieved 0% validity and executability rates on the obfuscated test set. Upon examining the generated plans, we discovered an intriguing pattern: the model tends to ignore the obfuscated domain context and instead produced actions from the original Blocksworld domain.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section C.2 Obfuscated Prompts: BLOCKSWORLD
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: The LLM planner had no exposure to the obfuscated domain during training. Our results showed that achieved 0% validity and executability rates on the obfuscated test set. Upon examining the generated plans, we discovered an intriguing pattern: the model tends to ignore the obfuscated domain context and instead produced actions from the original Blocksworld domain.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The model tends to ignore the obfuscated domain context and instead produced actions from the original Blocksworld domain.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on the model's performance on a test set with no prior exposure to the obfuscated domain. The consistent pattern of ignoring the obfuscated context and generating actions from the original domain strengthens the conclusion.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific Blocksworld domain and obfuscated context. Further research is needed to generalize this behavior across other domains and obfuscation methods.

Claim 4:
Statement: The model is able to identify errors in a high precision and recall rate, but fails to correct them effectively.
Location: Section D

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The model is able to identify errors in a high precision and recall rate, but fails to correct them effectively. This is evident from the probing tests results (Table 3) which show that the model achieves high precision (90.5%) and recall (99.2%) when all four strategies are combined (row 9). However, the detection capability does not lead to effective correction, indicating that future research should focus on how to leverage detected errors for correction.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.4
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: The model is able to identify errors in a high precision and recall rate, but fails to correct them effectively.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The model is able to identify errors in a high precision and recall rate, but fails to correct them effectively.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on quantitative results from probing tests, which provide a clear measure of the model's performance. The high precision and recall rates demonstrate the model's ability to identify errors, while the lack of effective correction highlights a limitation in its ability to leverage this capability.
  Limitations: The probing tests only evaluated the model's ability to identify errors in a specific context, and it is unclear whether this capability generalizes to other domains or tasks. Additionally, the tests only assessed the model's ability to correct errors in a limited number of attempts, and it is unknown whether the model would be able to correct errors with more attempts or different correction strategies.
  Location: Section D

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 5:
Statement: The model is unable to effectively correct its mistakes due to its inability to accurately parse the initial state.
Location: Section D

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The model fails to identify the next step in the plan sequence, as it does not acknowledge the presence of the green block in the scene.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section D
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Upon examining the visualization, it becomes evident that the next action should be to unstack the black block from the green block. Instead, the model does not acknowledge the presence of the green block in the scene.

- Evidence Text: The model attempts to continue manipulating the blue block but quickly realizes this approach is incorrect, leading it to generate a [WRONG] token.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section D
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: As a result, the LLM attempts to continue manipulating the blue block but quickly realizes this approach is incorrect, leading it to generate a [WRONG] token.

  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section D
  Limitations: This is a proposed solution and not direct evidence
  Exact Quote: A possible remedy for this issue is to introduce a more sophisticated mechanism that allows external expert to provide detailed feedback on why the model’s action is incorrect, enabling the model to learn from its mistakes more effectively.

  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: Assumes a relationship between goal satisfiability, executability, and validity rates
  Exact Quote: This result is reasonable, as improvements in both the executability and goal satisfiability rates would naturally lead to an increase in the final validity rate, which is not the case in our experiments.

  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific test sets and strategies evaluated in the study. Further research could explore the generalizability of these findings to other autoregressive models and planning tasks.
  Location: Section G

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 7:

  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on quantitative data from Table 5, which provides a clear comparison of goal satisfiability rates across different strategies. The data consistently shows a decrease in goal satisfiability rate for the State CoT strategy, supporting the claim.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the provided data and may not generalize to other planning tasks or models. Additionally, the conclusion relies on the assumption that the State CoT strategy's focus on state transition consistency is the primary cause of the drop in goal satisfiability rate.
