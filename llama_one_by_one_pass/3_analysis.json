                "justification_explanation": "The evidence provided in Figure 2 consistently shows that across both the GPT-3 and InstructGPT series, the inclusion of instructions and examples (ICL input form) leads to a significant increase in the self-knowledge of the models, as measured by the F1 score. This consistent trend across different models supports the conclusion.",
                "robustness_analysis": "The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical results from multiple models (GPT-3 and InstructGPT series) and shows a consistent positive effect of using the ICL input form on self-knowledge. The use of the F1 score as a metric provides a balanced view of precision and recall, further strengthening the evidence.",
                "limitations": "The study's focus on specific input forms (Direct, Instruction, and ICL) might not capture the full spectrum of how instructions and examples could influence self-knowledge in LLMs. Additionally, the generalizability of these findings to other LLM architectures not tested in the study could be a subject for further research.",
