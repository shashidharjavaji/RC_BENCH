Claim 6:
Statement: The authors propose using FuseMix to perform audio-to-image generation, conditioning GLIDE on audio prompts.
Location: Section 6.4

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We consider the recently proposed task [27] of generating images given audio prompts. The aim is to repurpose an existing text-to-image generative model to be conditioned on audio in lieu of text. Girdhar et al. [27] achieved this using a private reimplementation of DALLE-2 [69]. We opt to use FuseMix to perform this task while only using publicly available models: we use GLIDE[5] [62], a text-conditioned diffusion model which leverages CLIP[6] [67] to condition on text. We apply our method to align the latent space of Whisper into the latent space of CLIP to endow GLIDE with audio-conditioning capabilities (see supp. material).

  Limitations: None

Claim 7:
Statement: The authors find that conditioning GLIDE on audio prompts using FuseMix can produce samples of similar quality and fidelity as conditioning on text prompts.
Location: Section 6.4

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: In Figure 4, the authors provide examples of generated samples using various sounds. While they omit quantitative analysis for this task due to a lack of suitable metrics, they provide a qualitative comparison of each sample with a corresponding sample generated from the original text-conditioned GLIDE using a text prompt that is semantically equivalent to the audio prompt.
