Claim 4:
Statement: The authors conclude that CT results are not representative of each studied sample when aggregating across multiple prediction scenarios.
Location: Section 4

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The non-normalized results for combined samples seen in Figure 6 are dominated by the exact fact recall samples. The exact fact recall samples clearly lead to the decisive role conclusion and the same holds for the non-normalized results, even though subsets of the included data (heuristics recall and guesswork samples) do not lead to the same conclusion with as high certainty.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section G
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: For the non-normalized results we find that aggregations of CT results across multiple prediction scenarios are not representative of each studied sample.

- Evidence Text: For the normalized results we find that equal weights for all evaluated samples yield a slightly different pattern compared to the non-normalized results, with a weaker peak for the last subject token.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section G
  Limitations: Normalization method may affect results
  Exact Quote: Also, comparisons between non-normalized and normalized results may reveal nonhomogeneous datasets with respect to prediction scenario.

  Limitations: N/A

Location: Section 1

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors propose a method for creating model-specific PRISM datasets with samples that represent each of our identified prediction scenarios. They create PRISM datasets for GPT-2 XL, Llama 2 7B and Llama 2 13B, and use them to test the prediction scenario sensitivity of an influential interpretability method, causal tracing (CT).

Claim 7:
Statement: The authors find that the CounterFact dataset struggles to support precise and accurate interpretations of LMs due to its limitations.
Location: Appendix F

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The authors inspect the CounterFact dataset for three of four prediction scenarios and find that it contains samples likely to correspond to heuristics recall (510 samples) as opposed to exact fact recall (478 samples).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Appendix F.1
  Limitations: Limited representation of prediction scenarios
  Exact Quote: We inspect the CounterFact dataset for three of four prediction scenarios and find that it contains samples likely to correspond to heuristics recall (510 samples) as opposed to exact fact recall (478 samples).

- Evidence Text: The authors also find that approximately 365 known CounterFact samples have popularity scores below 1000, indicating they are unlikely to have been memorized by the model and may correspond to heuristics recall or random guesswork.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Appendix F.1
  Limitations: Limited representation of memorized facts
  Exact Quote: We also find that approximately 365 known CounterFact samples have popularity scores below 1000, indicating they are unlikely to have been memorized by the model and may correspond to heuristics recall or random guesswork.

- Evidence Text: Additionally, the authors identify 8 problematic samples in the dataset that contain the word 'not' in the query, which can lead to incorrect interpretations.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Appendix F.3
  Limitations: Presence of negated queries
  Exact Quote: We identify a total of 8 problematic samples in the dataset that contain the word 'not' in the query.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 8:
Statement: The authors propose using popularity metadata as a complement for separating exact fact recall samples from heuristics recall samples.
Location: Appendix F.1

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Using fact popularity, we also evaluate the known CounterFact samples through the lens of LM knowledge estimation. Table 10 lists the popularity scores distribution for the dataset. We find approximately 365 known CounterFact samples with popularity scores below 1000. These are unlikely to have been memorized by the model and are therefore unlikely to correspond to exact fact recall.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section F.1
  Limitations: None

We find approximately 365 known CounterFact samples with popularity scores below 1000.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors propose using popularity metadata as a complement for separating exact fact recall samples from heuristics recall samples.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a quantitative analysis of the popularity scores distribution, which provides a clear indication of the model's knowledge estimation. However, the robustness could be improved by considering additional factors that influence the model's behavior, such as the quality of the training data or the model's architecture.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific dataset (CounterFact) and model (GPT-2 XL). The generalizability of the findings to other datasets and models is not explicitly addressed.
  Location: Appendix F.1

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 9:
Statement: The authors find a spearman correlation of -0.41 between normalized TE and the binary prompt bias metric over all known CounterFact samples.
Location: Appendix F.2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: A deeper study of the TE values reveal an additional 37 samples for which the perturbation of the query subject decreased the original probability by less than 40%. For some of these samples we identify queries that potentially reveal the correct prediction even when the subject is perturbed. Two identified samples are “[X]” professionally plays the sport of ice [hockey]” or “[X]”’s expertise is in the field of quantum [physics]”. Prompt bias was detected for all of these queries. We measure a spearman correlation of -0.41 between normalized TE (Equation (3)) and the binary prompt bias metric over all known CounterFact samples.
  Strength: strong
  Location: F.2
  Limitations: None

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors find a spearman correlation of -0.41 between normalized TE and the binary prompt bias metric over all known CounterFact samples, indicating that the effect of perturbing the subject is smaller when the prediction is likely based on prompt bias, versus when it is not.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a quantitative measurement (spearman correlation) of a large dataset (all known CounterFact samples). The correlation coefficient (-0.41) indicates a moderate negative relationship, suggesting that the effect of perturbing the subject is indeed smaller when the prediction is likely based on prompt bias.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific dataset (CounterFact) and the defined metrics (normalized TE and binary prompt bias). The generalizability of the findings to other datasets and metrics is uncertain.

Claim 10:
Statement: The authors identify a total of 8 problematic samples in the CounterFact dataset that contain the word 'not' in the query.
Location: Appendix F.3

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We identify a total of 8 problematic samples in the dataset that contain the word “not” in the query. Two examples are “The language used by Louis Bonaparte is not the language of the [French]” or “The expertise of medical association is not in the field of [medicine]”.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Appendix F.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: We identify a total of 8 problematic samples in the dataset that contain the word “not” in the query. Two examples are “The language used by Louis Bonaparte is not the language of the [French]” or “The expertise of medical association is not in the field of [medicine]”.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors identify problematic samples in the CounterFact dataset due to the presence of the word 'not' in the query, which can lead to reversed or revealing prompts.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on a clear analysis of the dataset's content and the potential consequences of the sampling technique.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific examples provided and may not be generalizable to the entire dataset.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that aggregations of CT results across multiple prediction scenarios are not representative of each studied sample.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a thorough analysis of the CT results, including both non-normalized and normalized results. The comparison between the two types of results provides a comprehensive understanding of the issue.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific CT method and the datasets used in the study. The generalizability of the findings to other interpretability methods and datasets is not explicitly addressed.

The results in Figures 7 and 8 correspond to a sample of bottom-ranked prediction probabilities. We observe qualitative differences between the two figure pairs, where bottom-ranked probability set corresponds to larger effects for the last token state.
  Strength: strong

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors observe qualitative differences between the CT results for top-ranked and bottom-ranked prediction probabilities.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a direct comparison of CT results for two distinct probability sets. However, the analysis is limited to a specific model (GPT-2 XL) and may not generalize to other models or scenarios.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to a single model (GPT-2 XL) and may not be representative of other models or scenarios. Additionally, the evidence relies on visual inspection of figures, which may be subjective.

  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust, as it is based on the actual results of the analysis, which are presented in a figure. However, the robustness could be improved by providing more details about the analysis, such as the methodology used or the significance of the findings.
  Limitations: The conclusion is limited to the specific models (GPT-2 XL and Llama 2 7B) and heuristics recall categories (prompt bias and person name bias) analyzed. The generalizability of the findings to other models or categories is not explicitly addressed.
