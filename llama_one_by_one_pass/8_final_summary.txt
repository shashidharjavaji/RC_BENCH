Claim 2:
Statement: REPLUG LSR outperforms various off-the-shelf retrievers and leads to additional improvements, including up to 6.3% increase in GPT-3 (175B) language modeling.
Location: Section 7

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 1 reports the results of the original baselines, baselines augmented with the REPLUG, and baselines augmented with the REPLUG LSR. We observe that both REPLUG and REPLUG LSR significantly outperform the baselines. This demonstrates that simply adding a retrieval module to a frozen language model (i.e., the black-box setting) is effective at improving the performance of different sized language models on language modeling tasks. Furthermore, REPLUG LSR consistently performs better than REPLUG by a large margin. Specifically, REPLUG LSR results in 7.7% improvement over baselines compared to 4.7% improvement of REPLUG averaged over the 8 models.

Claim 6:
Statement: The performance gain brought by REPLUG does not simply come from the ensembling effect.
Location: Section 7.2

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: As shown in Figure 5, we evaluated the performance of GPT-3 Curie on Pile when augmented with random documents, documents retrieved by REPLUG, and documents retrieved by REPLUG LSR. We observed that ensembling random documents leads to worse performance, indicating that the performance gains of REPLUG do not come from the ensembling effect. Instead, ensembling the relevant documents is crucial for the success of REPLUG.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 7.2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: As shown in Figure 5, we evaluated the performance of GPT-3 Curie on Pile when augmented with random documents, documents retrieved by REPLUG, and documents retrieved by REPLUG LSR.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The performance gain brought by REPLUG does not simply come from the ensembling effect.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it provides a direct comparison between the performance of REPLUG with random documents, REPLUG, and REPLUG LSR. This controlled experiment effectively isolates the variable of document relevance, allowing for a clear conclusion.
  Limitations: The experiment's scope is limited to GPT-3 Curie on the Pile dataset. Further studies with diverse models and datasets could reinforce the conclusion.

Claim 7:
Statement: REPLUG is more helpful when texts contain rare entities.
Location: Appendix A

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Figure 7 shows a test context and its continuation from the Wikitext-103 test set. For REPLUG, we use the test context as a query to retrieve a relevant document from Wikitext-103 training data. We then compute the perplexity of the continuation using the original GPT-2 1.5B and its REPLUG enhanced version. After incorporating the retrieved document, the perplexity of the continuation improves by 11%. Among all tokens in the continuation, we found that REPLUG is most helpful for the rare entity name "Li Bai". This is likely because the original LM does not have sufficient information about this rare entity name. However, by incorporating the retrieved document, REPLUG was able to match the name with the relevant information in the retrieved document, resulting in better performance.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Appendix A
  Limitations: Limited to a specific example
  Exact Quote: After incorporating the retrieved document, the perplexity of the continuation improves by 11%. Among all tokens in the continuation, we found that REPLUG is most helpful for the rare entity name "Li Bai".

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: REPLUG is more helpful when texts contain rare entities.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a concrete example with measurable perplexity improvement. However, the generalizability of this finding to other rare entities and texts is not extensively explored.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to a single example and may not be representative of all cases involving rare entities. Further research is needed to confirm the claim's broader applicability.

Location: Appendix B

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: As depicted in Figure 8, we observe that BM25 consistently outperforms Contriever but falls short when compared to LM-supervised Contriever.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Appendix B
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: As depicted in Figure 8, we observe that BM25 consistently outperforms Contriever but falls short when compared to LM-supervised Contriever.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: BM25 outperforms Contriever but falls short when compared to LM-supervised Contriever, indicating that while BM25 is a strong retriever, the proposed LM-supervised training scheme further enhances the performance of Contriever.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on a direct comparison of the three retrievers across the same dataset, providing a clear and objective measure of their performance. However, the analysis could be further strengthened by evaluating the retrievers on additional datasets or tasks.
  Limitations: The comparison is limited to a single dataset (Wikitext-103) and a specific LM (GPT-2). The generalizability of the findings across different datasets and LMs is not explicitly evaluated.
