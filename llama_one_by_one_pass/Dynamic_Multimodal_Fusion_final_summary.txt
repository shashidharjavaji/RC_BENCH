Claim 4:
Statement: DynMM is more robust to noise and provides a good prediction for both scenarios.
Location: Section 4.4

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Figure 7 shows some qualitative segmentation results. While ESANet generates reasonable predictions in the normal setting (i.e., first and third row), its performance becomes significantly worse when multimodal data is perturbed by noise (i.e., the second and fourth row). On the contrary, our DynMM is robust to noise and provides a good prediction for both scenarios.

  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: DynMM is more robust to noise and provides a good prediction for both scenarios.

Conclusion:

  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on visual results that clearly show the difference in performance between DynMM and ESANet in both scenarios. The comparison is fair since both models are tested on the same data with and without noise.
  Limitations: The analysis is limited to the specific scenarios presented in Figure 7. More comprehensive testing across various noise levels and types could further strengthen the claim.

Claim 11:
Statement: The authors introduce a resource-aware loss function into the training objective to achieve efficient inference.
