Tran, Pat Verga, et al.\n\n**Research Question:** How to develop attributed large language models (LLMs) that can provide evidence for their generated text, and how to evaluate their performance?\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n1. **Task Definition:** Attributed Question Answering (QA) is defined as a task where the input is a question, and the output is an (answer, attribution) pair, where the attribution is a pointer to a fixed corpus.\n2. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n\t* **Human AIS (Attribution Score):** Gold-standard metric, assessed by human raters, evaluating whether the answer is attributable to the provided attribution.\n\t* **AutoAIS:** Automatic metric, formulating evaluation as a Natural Language Inference task, correlating well with human AIS at the system level.\n\t* **Exact Match (EM):** Measures answer string accuracy, but has limitations in evaluating attribution.\n3. **System Architectures:**\n\t* **Retrieve-then-read (RTR):** Performs retrieval of relevant passages, then generates an answer and selects an attribution.\n\t* **Post-hoc Retrieval:** Generates an answer using an LLM, then retrieves an attribution using the question and answer as a query.\n\t* **LLM-as-retriever:** Uses an LLM to generate both an answer and a pointer to the attribution corpus.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Best Performing System:** RTR achieves the highest performance, but requires large amounts of explicit supervision.\n2. **Correlation between AIS and EM/AutoAIS:**\n\t* **AIS and EM:** Modest correlation (0.45), highlighting EM's limitations in evaluating attribution.\n\t* **AIS and AutoAIS:** Strong correlation (0.96) at the system level, making AutoAIS a suitable development metric.\n3. **Challenges and Future Directions:**\n\t* **Post-hoc Attribution:** Remains challenging, but is a viable architecture for future work.\n\t* **End-to-end Modeling:** Shows promise, but requires further development.\n\t* **Evaluation Metrics:** AutoAIS has limitations at the instance level, and human rating data can be used to improve automatic evaluation metrics.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n\n| **Claim ID** | **Claim** | **Evidence** | **Evaluation** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Attributed QA is a crucial task for LLMs in information-seeking scenarios. | *Supporting Evidence:* Rashkin et al. (2021), Thoppilan et al. (2022), Menick et al. (2022) | *Conclusion Justified:* True, *Robustness:* High, *Justification:* Attribution allows users to assess trustworthiness and nuance, *Key Limitations:* None, *Confidence Level:* High |\n| 2 | AutoAIS is a suitable development metric for Attributed QA. | *Supporting Evidence:* Strong correlation with human AIS at the system level (0.96) | *Conclusion Justified:* True, *Robustness:* High, *Justification:* Correlation with human AIS, *Key Limitations:* Instance-level correlation is lower, *Confidence Level:* High |\n| 3 | RTR achieves the highest performance in Attributed QA. | *Supporting Evidence:* Experimental results (Table 1) | *Conclusion Justified:* True, *Robustness:* High, *Justification:* RTR's strong performance, *Key Limitations:* Requires large amounts of explicit supervision, *Confidence Level:* High |\n\n**Limitations and Future Work:**\n\n1. **Evaluation Metrics:** Improve AutoAIS's instance-level correlation and explore other automatic evaluation metrics.\n2. **End-to-end Modeling:** Develop training signals for end-to-end modeling, such as using AutoAIS as a noisy training signal.\n3. **Post-hoc Attribution:** Study the challenge of retrieval for post-hoc attribution and devise solutions.\n4. **Multilingual and Multimodal Attribution:** Evaluate Attributed QA in different languages and modalities.",
