Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: Combining tabular data from financial semi-structured documents with text transcripts and audio recordings improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12%.
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: Combining tabular data from financial semi-structured documents with text transcripts and audio recordings improves stock volatility and price movement prediction by 5-12%.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 3 shows the performance of several baseline and SOTA models for predicting price movement and stock volatility for Merger & Acquisition calls on the M&A dataset.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4: Results and Discussion
  Limitations: Limited to M&A dataset
  Exact Quote: Table 3: Mean τ -day volatility (MSE) and price movement prediction (F1 score) results for Merger & Acquisition calls (M&A dataset) across several models.

- Evidence Text: Table 4 reports the volatility prediction performance on the MAEC dataset.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4: Results and Discussion
  Limitations: Limited to MAEC dataset
  Exact Quote: Table 4: Mean τ -day MSE for stock volatility prediction for Earnings Calls (MAEC dataset) across several methods.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence from Tables 3 and 4 supports the claim, showing significant improvements in stock volatility and price movement prediction across multiple datasets.

Claim 2:
Type: contribution
Statement: The proposed approach reduces gender bias learned by audio-based neural networks by over 30%.
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: The proposed approach reduces gender bias learned by audio-based neural networks by over 30%.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 6 shows the modality specific ∆G i.e. the difference between the MSE and F1 for volatility prediction in Earnings Calls dataset and price prediction in M&A calls, respectively for 3, 7, and 15 days over 5 runs.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1: Bias Reduction through Company Filings
  Limitations: Limited to specific modalities and datasets
  Exact Quote: Table 6: Modality specific ∆G i.e. the difference between the MSE and F1 for volatility prediction in Earnings Calls dataset and price prediction in M&A calls, respectively for 3, 7, and 15 days over 5 runs.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence from Table 6 supports the claim, demonstrating a significant reduction in gender bias across multiple modalities and datasets.
