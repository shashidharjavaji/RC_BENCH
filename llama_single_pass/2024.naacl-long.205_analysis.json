The benchmark consists of two tasks: TSort, which requires arranging text segments in the correct order, and BestAnswer, which involves selecting the most helpful answer from a set of options. The paper evaluates 4 proprietary and 6 open-source LLMs on Ada-LEval, revealing significant performance gaps between proprietary and open-source models. The results highlight the limitations of current LLMs, particularly in ultra-long-context settings.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Novel Benchmark:** Ada-LEval is a pioneering benchmark that evaluates LLMs' long-context capabilities with length-adaptable questions.\n2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper assesses multiple LLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, providing a thorough understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.\n3. **Task Design:** The two tasks, TSort and BestAnswer, are well-designed to require comprehensive understanding and reasoning over long text.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Limited Applicability:** The benchmark's difficulty rises sharply under ultra-long-context settings, constraining its applicability to current LLMs.\n2. **Poor Instruction Following Rate:** Open-source LLMs struggle with following instructions, making it challenging to distinguish their long-context capabilities.\n3. **Dependence on Proprietary Models:** The evaluation relies heavily on proprietary models, which may not be accessible to all researchers.\n\n**Claims and Evidence:**\n\n1. **Claim:** Ada-LEval is a challenging benchmark that requires strong understanding and reasoning capabilities over long text.\n\t* **Evidence:** The paper's results, particularly the poor performance of open-source LLMs and the significant performance gaps between proprietary and open-source models.\n2. **Claim:** The benchmark's difficulty rises sharply under ultra-long-context settings.\n\t* **Evidence:** The results in Table 6, which show a dramatic decline in performance for all evaluated models under ultra-long-context settings.\n3. **Claim:** Open-source LLMs struggle with following instructions, making it challenging to distinguish their long-context capabilities.\n\t* **Evidence:** The instruction following rate and copy instruction rate statistics in Tables 4 and 5, which highlight the struggles of open-source LLMs.\n\n**Evaluation of Evidence:**\n\n1. **Conclusions Justified:** The evidence generally supports the claims, but the paper could benefit from more in-depth analysis of the results.\n2. **Robustness:** The evaluation is robust, as it assesses multiple LLMs and tasks. However, the reliance on proprietary models may introduce some bias.\n3. **Justification:** The paper provides clear explanations for the evidence-conclusion alignment, but could further elaborate on the implications of the results.\n4. **Key Limitations:** The paper acknowledges the limitations of the benchmark, particularly its applicability to current LLMs.\n5. **Confidence Level:** The confidence level is generally high, as the results are consistent across multiple evaluations. However, the paper could benefit from more nuanced confidence assessments.\n\n**Confidence Level:** High (8/10)\n\n**Rating:** 8.5/10\n\n**Recommendations for Future Work:**\n\n1. **Improve Benchmark Applicability:** Enhance the benchmark to accommodate current LLMs' capabilities, ensuring its continued relevance.\n2. **Increase Open-Source Model Representation:** Evaluate a more diverse set of open-source LLMs to reduce dependence on proprietary models.\n3. **In-Depth Analysis:** Provide more detailed analysis of the results, exploring the implications of the findings and potential avenues for improvement.",
