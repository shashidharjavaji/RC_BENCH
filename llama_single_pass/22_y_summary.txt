Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: The proposed JMRI framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets.
Location: Section IV, Subsection D
Exact Quote: Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against the state-of-the-arts.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Top-1 accuracy on ReferItGame (JMRI II: 71.65%), Flickr30K Entities (JMRI I: 81.23%, JMRI II: 82.11%), RefCOCO (JMRI II: 85.95% on val, 86.47% on testA), RefCOCO+ (JMRI II: 87.05% on val, 86.21% on testA), and RefCOCOg (JMRI II: 84.28% on val-g, 83.36% on test-u).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Tables III and IV
  Limitations: Dataset-specific performance might not generalize to other visual grounding tasks.
  Exact Quote: See Tables III and IV for detailed results.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence strongly supports the claim, showcasing the framework's effectiveness across multiple datasets.
Key Limitations: Dataset specificity

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: The early joint representation module in JMRI effectively captures semantic correspondences between vision and language.
Location: Section III, Subsection A
Exact Quote: The resulting joint representations serve as inputs for later fusion, enabling the model to locate the referred object more accurately.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Grad-CAM visualization highlights image regions considered important for the target object, even if not precisely localized (Fig. 3).
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Fig. 3 and accompanying text
  Limitations: Limited to qualitative analysis; quantitative evaluation is not provided.
  Exact Quote: See Fig. 3 for visualization examples.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence supports the claim, but its qualitative nature leaves room for more comprehensive evaluation.
Key Limitations: Lack of quantitative evaluation

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: contribution
Statement: The proposed JMRI framework can perform zero-shot grounding on certain new visual concepts in the open world.
Location: Section IV, Subsection E
Exact Quote: The results show that the proposed model can perform zero-shot grounding on certain new visual concepts in the open world, such as Sun Wukong, white dragon, mountain wall, and even abstract words.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Visualization of zero-shot prediction (Fig. 5) demonstrates the model's ability to generalize to unseen concepts.
  Strength: weak
  Location: Fig. 5 and accompanying text
  Limitations: Limited to a few examples; lacks comprehensive evaluation.
  Exact Quote: See Fig. 5 for zero-shot prediction examples.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: low
Confidence Level: low
Justification: The evidence is intriguing but lacks the breadth and depth to conclusively support the claim.
Key Limitations: Limited scope of examples
