Rush, Tanya Goyal\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n### Claim 1: Open community-driven platforms like Chatbot Arena are widely accepted as trustworthy benchmarks for LLM performance.\n\n*   **Claim:**\n    *   **Text:** \"Open community-driven platforms like Chatbot Arena have gained a reputation as one of the most trustworthy publicly available benchmarks for LLM performance.\"\n    *   **Type:** Contribution\n    *   **Location:** Abstract\n    *   **Exact Quote:** \"Open community-driven platforms like Chatbot Arena have gained a reputation as one of the most trustworthy publicly available benchmarks for LLM performance.\"\n*   **Evidence:**\n    *   **Evidence Text:** \"2,011,939 pairwise preference judgments collected by Chatbot Arena as of October 6, 2024\"\n    *   **Strength:** Moderate (large dataset, but lacks diversity and representativeness information)\n    *   **Limitations:** Dataset size and collection date might not reflect the current state of LLM performance.\n    *   **Location:** Section 1, Introduction\n    *   **Exact Quote:** \"As of October 6, 2024, Chatbot Arena has collected 2,011,939 pairwise preference judgments.\"\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   **Conclusion Justified:** True\n    *   **Robustness:** Medium (dependent on the dataset's representativeness and the platform's continued usage)\n    *   **Justification:** The large dataset supports the claim, but its limitations (size, date) might affect the conclusion's robustness.\n    *   **Key Limitations:** Dataset representativeness and collection date.\n    *   **Confidence Level:** Medium\n\n### Claim 2: Only 10% of poor-quality annotations can change the leaderboard rankings of 2/3 models by 5 places.\n\n*   **Claim:**\n    *   **Text:** \"Only 10% of poor-quality annotations can change the leaderboard rankings of 2/3 models by 5 places.\"\n    *   **Type:** Result\n    *   **Location:** Section 3.1, Apathetic Voting\n    *   **Exact Quote:** \"We find that only 10% of apathetic votes in the dataset can change the leaderboard rankings of 2/3 models by 5 places.\"\n*   **Evidence:**\n    *   **Evidence Text:** Table 1, showing the change in leaderboard rankings for 3 test models based on different percentages of arbitrary votes.\n    *   **Strength:** Strong (experimental results with clear, quantifiable outcomes)\n    *   **Limitations:** Limited to the specific models and dataset used in the experiment.\n    *   **Location:** Section 3.1, Apathetic Voting\n    *   **Exact Quote:** Table 1.\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   **Conclusion Justified:** True\n    *   **Robustness:** High (clear, quantifiable experimental results)\n    *   **Justification:** The experimental results strongly support the claim, with minimal limitations.\n    *   **Key Limitations:** Generalizability to other models and datasets.\n    *   **Confidence Level:** High\n\n### Claim 3: Adversarial attacks can substantially change leaderboard rankings if adversaries contribute 10% of the votes.\n\n*   **Claim:**\n    *   **Text:** \"Adversarial attacks can substantially change leaderboard rankings if adversaries contribute 10% of the votes.\"\n    *   **Type:** Result\n    *   **Location:** Section 3.2, Adversarial Voting\n    *   **Exact Quote:** \"Across all models, we show that adversarial attacks can substantially change leaderboard rankings if adversaries get to contribute 10% votes for their model.\"\n*   **Evidence:**\n    *   **Evidence Text:** Table 2, showing the change in leaderboard rankings for 3 test models based on different percentages of adversarial votes.\n    *   **Strength:** Strong (experimental results with clear, quantifiable outcomes)\n    *   **Limitations:** Limited to the specific attack methodology and models used in the experiment.\n    *   **Location:** Section 3.2, Adversarial Voting\n    *   **Exact Quote:** Table 2.\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   **Conclusion Justified:** True\n    *   **Robustness:** High (clear, quantifiable experimental results)\n    *   **Justification:** The experimental results strongly support the claim, with minimal limitations.\n    *   **Key Limitations:** Generalizability to other attack methodologies and models.\n    *   **Confidence Level:** High\n\n### Claim 4: Traditional approaches like filtering out low-quality users/annotations using inter-annotator agreement may not be viable for open-ended queries.\n\n*   **Claim:**\n    *   **Text:** \"Traditional approaches like filtering out low-quality users/annotations using inter-annotator agreement may not be viable for open-ended queries.\"\n    *   **Type:** Contribution\n    *   **Location:** Section 3.3, Arbitrary Voting\n    *   **Exact Quote:** \"More concerningly, the results highlight that traditional approaches like filtering out low-quality users/annotations using inter-annotator agreement may not be a viable strategy for open-ended queries as it is difficult to disentangle between of low inter-annotator agreement due to bad annotation (apathetic votes) or inherent subjectivity.\"\n*   **Evidence:**\n    *   **Evidence Text:** Table 4, showing the low inter-annotator agreement on different evaluation axes for open-ended questions.\n    *   **Strength:** Moderate (based on a small-scale annotation study)\n    *   **Limitations:** Limited to the specific study and evaluation axes used.\n    *   **Location:** Section 3.3, Arbitrary Voting\n    *   **Exact Quote:** Table 4.\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   **Conclusion Justified:** True\n    *   **Robustness:** Medium (dependent on the study's representativeness and generalizability)\n    *   **Justification:** The study's results support the claim, but with notable limitations.\n    *   **Key Limitations:** Study size and evaluation axes.\n    *   **Confidence Level:** Medium",
