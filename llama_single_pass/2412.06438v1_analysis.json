Sawyer, Hubert Soyer, Martin Engelcke, David P Reichert, Drew A. Hudson, John Reid, Alexander Lerchner, Danilo Jimenez Rezende, Timothy P Lillicrap, Michael Mozer, Jane X Wang\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis paper introduces a framework for evaluating the ability of foundation models to actively gather information in interactive environments to test hypotheses. The authors investigate the capacity and efficiency of foundation models in both text-based and 3D embodied environments, using in-context prompting alone and without requiring task-specific training or fine-tuning.\n\n**Claims and Evidence:**\n\n1. **Claim:** Foundation models can efficiently gather information in interactive environments to test hypotheses.\n\t* **Evidence:** Experimental results in text-based and 3D embodied environments, showing that Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash outperform random baselines and approach optimal baselines in exploration efficiency.\n\t* **Evaluation:**\n\t\t+ **Conclusion Justified:** True\n\t\t+ **Robustness:** High\n\t\t+ **Justification:** The evidence demonstrates that foundation models can efficiently gather information in interactive environments, supporting the claim.\n\t\t+ **Key Limitations:** Limited to specific environments and tasks.\n\t\t+ **Confidence Level:** High\n\n2. **Claim:** The size of a foundation model impacts its exploration capabilities.\n\t* **Evidence:** Statistical analysis comparing Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash, showing that Gemini Flash excels with simpler reward functions, while Gemini Pro with self-correction performs better on more complex reward functions.\n\t* **Evaluation:**\n\t\t+ **Conclusion Justified:** True\n\t\t+ **Robustness:** Medium\n\t\t+ **Justification:** The evidence suggests a trade-off between model size and reward function complexity, supporting the claim.\n\t\t+ **Key Limitations:** Limited to specific model variants and tasks.\n\t\t+ **Confidence Level:** Medium\n\n3. **Claim:** Improving visual accuracy is crucial for achieving comparable performance in 3D embodied environments.\n\t* **Evidence:** Results in the Construction Lab environment, showing that errors in the vision step, rather than reasoning or exploration, are responsible for reduced accuracy in the Gemini agent condition.\n\t* **Evaluation:**\n\t\t+ **Conclusion Justified:** True\n\t\t+ **Robustness:** High\n\t\t+ **Justification:** The evidence highlights the importance of visual accuracy in 3D embodied environments, supporting the claim.\n\t\t+ **Key Limitations:** Limited to the specific 3D environment and task.\n\t\t+ **Confidence Level:** High\n\n**Methodology and Contributions:**\n\n* **Methodology:** The authors propose a novel framework for evaluating the directed exploration capabilities of LLMs and VLMs in interactive environments, outlining methodologies for assessment in the zero-shot setting, without the need for fine-tuning or other post-training modifications.\n* **Contributions:**\n\t+ **Framework Development:** A new framework for evaluating directed exploration capabilities in interactive environments.\n\t+ **Empirical Analysis:** Extensive experiments across various environments and tasks, analyzing the exploration performance and behaviors of LLMs and VLMs in interactive settings.\n\t+ **Insights and Implications:** A detailed discussion on the implications of the findings for future research in foundation models and the development of autonomous intelligent agents.\n\n**Performance and Results:**\n\n* **Exploration Efficiency:** Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash outperform random baselines and approach optimal baselines in exploration efficiency.\n* **Property Identification Accuracy:** The authors assess the accuracy with which the model identifies the rewarding property or properties based on its observations collected during a fixed budget of exploration steps.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work:**\n\n* **Limitations:**\n\t+ **Environment and Task Complexity:** The study is limited to specific environments and tasks.\n\t+ **Model Variants:** The analysis is restricted to Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash.\n* **Future Work:**\n\t+ **Improving Visual Accuracy:** Fine-tuning or enhancing visual perception capabilities in foundation models.\n\t+ **Replacing Human Actors:** Utilizing language-conditioned agents or real-world footage in 3D embodied environments.\n\t+ **Exploring More Complex Environments:** Investigating the generalizability of directed exploration capabilities to more complex environments and tasks.",
