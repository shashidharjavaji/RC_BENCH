Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Language models (LMs) can process factual information in different ways, including fact recall, heuristics, and guesswork.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: Previous interpretations of language models (LMs) miss important distinctions in how these models process factual information.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Analysis of four prediction scenarios: exact fact recall, heuristics recall, guesswork, and generic language modeling.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3
  Limitations: Limited to auto-regressive models and subject-first template queries.
  Exact Quote: We identify four prediction scenarios that are fundamentally different and of differing reliability.

- Evidence Text: Creation of PRISM datasets for GPT-2 XL, Llama 2 7B, and Llama 2 13B.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3
  Limitations: Dependent on model biases and parametric memories, which differ between LMs.
  Exact Quote: We develop PRISM datasets for GPT-2 XL, Llama 2 7B, and Llama 2 13B, respectively.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim by demonstrating the existence of different prediction scenarios and the importance of precise testing data.
Key Limitations: Limited generalizability to other LM architectures and query types.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: Causal tracing (CT) results are sensitive to the underlying prediction scenario(s).
Location: Section 4
Exact Quote: Do CT results and the corresponding conclusions change with the underlying prediction scenario(s)?

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: CT analysis on PRISM datasets for each prediction scenario in isolation and in combination.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: Limited to the CT method and the specific LMs used.
  Exact Quote: We find that different prediction scenarios yield distinct CT results if studied in isolation.

- Evidence Text: Comparison of CT results for combined samples with and without normalization.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: Dependent on the normalization method used.
  Exact Quote: We conclude that aggregations of CT results across multiple prediction scenarios are not representative of each studied sample.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim by demonstrating the sensitivity of CT results to the prediction scenario and the importance of normalization.
Key Limitations: Limited to the CT method and the specific LMs used.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: contribution
Statement: The CounterFact dataset is not suitable for precise and comprehensive interpretations of LMs due to its limitations.
Location: Section 5
Exact Quote: Our results are limited to auto-regressive models and subject-first template queries.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Inspection of the CounterFact dataset for prediction scenarios and quality issues.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Appendix F
  Limitations: Limited to the specific analysis performed.
  Exact Quote: We find samples likely to correspond to heuristics recall, low-popularity samples, and problematic samples with negated queries.

- Evidence Text: Comparison with the proposed PRISM dataset.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5
  Limitations: None mentioned.
  Exact Quote: Our proposed PRISM dataset does not suffer from the aforementioned limitations.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim by highlighting the limitations of the CounterFact dataset and the advantages of the proposed PRISM dataset.
Key Limitations: None mentioned.
