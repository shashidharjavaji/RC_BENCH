Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: Teaching language models to support answers with verified quotes
Location: Title
Exact Quote: Teaching language models to support answers with verified quotes

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The paper proposes a method for teaching language models to provide verified quotes to support their answers.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: None mentioned
  Exact Quote: The paper proposes a method for teaching language models to provide verified quotes to support their answers.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is directly supported by the paper's introduction, which clearly states the method's purpose.
Key Limitations: None

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: The proposed method, GopherCite, achieves high-quality supporting evidence for factual claims.
Location: Section 3.1
Exact Quote: Our best models produce high quality supporting evidence for their factual claims.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: On short-answer questions drawn from the NaturalQuestionsFiltered dataset, the best model produces plausible and supported claims 80% of the time.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.1
  Limitations: Evaluated on a specific dataset
  Exact Quote: On short-answer questions drawn from the NaturalQuestionsFiltered dataset, the best model produces plausible and supported claims 80% of the time.

- Evidence Text: On explanation-seeking questions from the ELI5Filtered dataset, the model produces plausible and supported claims 67% of the time.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.1
  Limitations: Evaluated on a specific dataset
  Exact Quote: On explanation-seeking questions from the ELI5Filtered dataset, the model produces plausible and supported claims 67% of the time.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported by the evaluation results on two datasets, demonstrating the model's effectiveness.
Key Limitations: Dataset specificity

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: methodology
Statement: Learning from human preferences improves GopherCite decisively over purely supervised baselines.
Location: Section 3.2
Exact Quote: Learning from human preferences improves GopherCite decisively over purely supervised baselines.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Both reranking with a reward model, as well as reinforcement learning, significantly improve scores achieved by the models on both evaluation datasets.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.2
  Limitations: None mentioned
  Exact Quote: Both reranking with a reward model, as well as reinforcement learning, significantly improve scores achieved by the models on both evaluation datasets.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is directly supported by the comparison of human preference scores between the proposed method and supervised baselines.
Key Limitations: None

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 4:
Type: performance
Statement: Declining to answer substantially improves the model's performance by answering only selected questions.
Location: Section 3.3
Exact Quote: Declining to answer substantially improves these numbers by answering only selected ques- tions whilst still attempting a large majority.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Using thresholds on reward model scores under which the model abstains from answering results in higher Supported&Plausible human ratings on the resulting subset of attempted questions.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: Evaluated on a specific approach to declining to answer
  Exact Quote: Using thresholds on reward model scores under which the model abstains from answering results in higher Supported&Plausible human ratings on the resulting subset of attempted questions.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported by the evaluation results of the declining to answer approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving performance.
Key Limitations: Approach specificity
