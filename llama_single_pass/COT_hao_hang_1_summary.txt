Claim 1:
Type: contribution/performance
Statement: Chain-of-thought prompting significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning.
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: We explore how generating a chain of thought—a series of intermediate reasoning steps—significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experiments on three large language models show that chain-of-thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3, 4, and 5
  Limitations: Limited to specific tasks and models
  Exact Quote: Experiments on three large language models show that chain-of-thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.

- Evidence Text: Chain-of-thought prompting outperforms standard prompting for various large language models on five arithmetic reasoning benchmarks (Table 1).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1
  Limitations: Specific to arithmetic reasoning tasks
  Exact Quote: Chain-of-thought prompting outperforms standard prompting for various large language models on five arithmetic reasoning benchmarks (Table 1).

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim by demonstrating the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting across various models and tasks.
Key Limitations: Limited generalizability to other tasks and models

Claim 2:
Type: contribution/performance
Statement: Chain-of-thought prompting is an emergent property of model scale that allows sufficiently large language models to perform reasoning tasks that otherwise have flat scaling curves.
Location: Section 6
Exact Quote: Chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent property of model scale that allows sufficiently large language models to perform reasoning tasks that otherwise have flat scaling curves.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect shows that scaling PaLM to 540B fixed a substantial portion of errors in all categories (Figure 9).
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Appendix A.1
  Limitations: Limited to error analysis of a specific model
  Exact Quote: Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect shows that scaling PaLM to 540B fixed a substantial portion of errors in all categories (Figure 9).

- Evidence Text: Chain-of-thought prompting improves performance across all three models (LaMDA, GPT-3, and PaLM) for all datasets except CSQA and StrategyQA for GPT-3 (Table 1, Table 4, Table 5).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Table 1, Table 4, Table 5
  Limitations: Specific to certain models and datasets
  Exact Quote: Chain-of-thought prompting improves performance across all three models (LaMDA, GPT-3, and PaLM) for all datasets except CSQA and StrategyQA for GPT-3 (Table 1, Table 4, Table 5).

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The evidence supports the claim by demonstrating the relationship between model scale and chain-of-thought prompting effectiveness, although with some limitations.
Key Limitations: Limited to specific models and datasets
