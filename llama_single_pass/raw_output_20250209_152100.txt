**Summary:**
This paper investigates the self-knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) by evaluating their ability to identify unanswerable questions. The authors introduce a novel dataset, SelfAware, and an automated method for detecting uncertainty in model responses. Experimental results on 20 LLMs, including GPT-3, InstructGPT, and LLaMA, demonstrate that in-context learning and instruction tuning can enhance self-knowledge. However, a significant gap remains between the capabilities of these models and human proficiency in recognizing knowledge limitations.
