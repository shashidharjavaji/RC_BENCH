**Claims and Evidence Summary:**

1. **Static Method for Neuron-Level Knowledge Attribution:**
   - **Claim:** A proposed static method for pinpointing significant neurons in large language models.
   - **Evidence:** Superior performance across three metrics compared to seven other methods.
   - **Evaluation:** Strong evidence supports the method's effectiveness, but generalizability to other knowledge types and models is a key limitation.

2. **Knowledge Storage in Deep Layers:**
   - **Claim:** Both attention and FFN layers store knowledge, with top10 layers in deep layers.
   - **Evidence:** Layer-level knowledge storage analysis in GPT2 and Llama.
   - **Evaluation:** Strong evidence directly supports the claim, but specifics in other models are not explored.

3. **Influence of Few Neurons on Predictions:**
   - **Claim:** Intervening a few value or query neurons significantly influences final predictions.
   - **Evidence:** Intervention experiments on top200 attention and top100 FFN neurons.
   - **Evaluation:** Strong evidence supports the claim, but generalizability of intervention effects across models and scenarios is a limitation.
