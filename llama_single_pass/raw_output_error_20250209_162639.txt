    *   **Evidence Text:** Figure 3: Prompt entropy across layers of Pythia 410M under various extreme input conditions
    *   **Strength:** Strong
    *   **Limitations:** Limited to the specific input perturbations evaluated
    *   **Location:** Figure 3, Section 4.3.3
    *   **Exact Quote:** "Increasing token repetition reduces entropy in intermediate layers... Increasing token randomness elevates entropy, particularly in initial layers."
