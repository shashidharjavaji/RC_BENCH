**Summary:**

This paper introduces a framework for evaluating the ability of foundation models to actively gather information in interactive environments to test hypotheses. The authors investigate the capacity and efficiency of foundation models in both text-based and 3D embodied environments, using in-context prompting alone and without requiring task-specific training or fine-tuning.
