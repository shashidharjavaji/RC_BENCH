=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: The paper introduces the HANS dataset, an NLI evaluation set that tests specific hypotheses about invalid heuristics that NLI models are likely to learn.
Location: Abstract
Type: Introduction of a novel dataset
Quote: The paper introduces the HANS dataset, an NLI evaluation set that tests specific hypotheses about invalid heuristics that NLI models are likely to learn.

Evidence:
- The paper introduces the HANS dataset, an NLI evaluation set that tests specific hypotheses about invalid heuristics that NLI models are likely to learn.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Abstract
  Limitations: None
  Quote: The paper introduces the HANS dataset, an NLI evaluation set that tests specific hypotheses about invalid heuristics that NLI models are likely to learn.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: None
Confidence: high

==================================================

Claim 2:
Statement: The paper finds that four existing NLI models perform very poorly on HANS, suggesting that their high accuracies on NLI test sets may be due to the exploitation of invalid heuristics rather than deeper understanding of language.

Type: Finding of model performance
