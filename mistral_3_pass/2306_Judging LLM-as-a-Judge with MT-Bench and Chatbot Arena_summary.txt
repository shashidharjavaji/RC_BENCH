Claim 2:
Statement: We argue that this discrepancy primarily arises due to existing evaluation that only measures LLMs’ core capability on a confined set of tasks (e.g., multi-choice knowledge or retrieval questions), without adequately assessing its alignment with human preference in open-ended tasks, such as the ability to accurately adhere to instructions in multi-turn dialogues.
