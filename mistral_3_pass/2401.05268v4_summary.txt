=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Raw Claims:
The provided text is a research paper titled "AUTOACT: Automatic Agent Learning from Scratch for QA via Self-Planning." The paper introduces a framework called AUTOACT, which is designed to enable automatic agent learning for question-answering tasks without relying on large-scale annotated data or synthetic planning trajectories from closed-source models. The framework leverages a division-of-labor strategy to differentiate the agent into sub-agents with distinct functions, such as task decomposition, tool invocation, and self-reflection.

The paper discusses the following key components of AUTOACT:

1. **META-AGENT**: The META-AGENT is responsible for all the preparatory work before self-differentiation and serves as the backbone model for all sub-agents. It can be initialized with any kind of open-source model.

2. **Target Task Information**: The task information at hand is quite limited, primarily encompassing three aspects: task name, task description, and task data examples. The task information serves as the only user-provided knowledge of the task for AUTOACT to conduct automatic agent learning.

3. **Tool Library**: A comprehensive tool library is provided to facilitate the agents in automatic task planning. The tool library can be denoted as T = {mi, di, ui}i[|T |]=1[, where m represents the tool name, d defines the tool functionality, u details the tool usage instruction, and |T | stands for the tool amount of the library.

4. **Self-Instruct**: To acquire a sufficient amount of task data and provide an ample training resource, the data is augmented through self-instruct. The META-AGENT generates new question-answer pairs by few-shot prompting, and the few-shot prompt examples are randomly sampled from the task data examples.

5. **Automatic Agent Learning via Self-Planning**: The META-AGENT selects applicable tools for each task automatically, synthesizes planning trajectories on its own, and differentiates the META-AGENT into three sub-agents with distinct functionalities: PLAN-AGENT, TOOL-AGENT, and REFLECT-AGENT.

The paper also presents experimental results and analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of the division-of-labor strategy and the quality of trajectories synthesized by AUTOACT. The results show that AUTOACT yields better or parallel performance compared to various strong baselines.

The paper concludes by discussing the limitations of the current approach and suggesting future directions for research, such as expanding AUTOACT to more realistic task scenarios, boosting more knowledge via self-instruct, and iteratively enhancing synthetic trajectories via self-improvement.

Overall, the paper presents a novel approach to automatic agent learning for question-answering tasks, leveraging a division-of-labor strategy to enable efficient and effective learning from scratch.
