=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot, by themselves, do planning or self-verification.
Location: Abstract
Type: Position
Quote: We argue that auto-regressive LLMs cannot, by themselves, do planning or self-verification (which is after all a form of reasoning), and shed some light on the reasons for misunderstandings in the literature.

Evidence:
- Despite initial claims about the planning capabilities of LLMs, several recent studies confirm that LLMs are not actually able to generate executable plans when they are used in autonomous modes.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 2.1
  Limitations: None

Claim 2:
Statement: LLMs should be viewed as universal approximate knowledge sources.
Location: Abstract
Type: Position
Quote: We argue that LLMs should be viewed as universal approximate knowledge sources that have much more meaningful roles to play in planning/reasoning tasks beyond simple front-end/back-end format translators.

Claim 3:
Statement: LLMs can be a whole lot more than machine translators.
Location: Introduction
Type: Position
Quote: They are a kind of approximate knowledge source (albeit sans guarantees) trained on our collective consciousness. While it is unlikely that they will have System 2 competencies by themselves, they can nevertheless be valuable resources in solving System 2 tasks.

Claim 4:
Statement: LLMs can generate ideas/potential candidate solutions.
Location: Introduction
Type: Position
Quote: Their uncanny ability to generate ideas/potential candidate solutions–albeit with no guarantees about those guesses–can be valuable in the generate-test-critique setups in conjunction with either model-based verifiers or expert humans in the loop.

Evidence:
- The LLM-Modulo Framework proposed in this position paper tackles this challenge.

Claim 6:
Statement: LLMs cannot verify plans and thus cannot improve by self-critiquing.
Location: 2.2. LLMs cannot verify plans and thus cannot improve by self-critiquing
Type: Finding
Quote: There still exists considerable optimism that even if LLMs can’t generate correct solutions in one go, their accuracy might improve in an iterative prompting regime, where LLMs will be able to “self-critique” their candidate solutions and refine them to the point of correctness (Yao et al., 2023b;a; Shinn et al., 2023; Weng et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022).

Location: 3.5. Can LLM-Modulo Frameworks Pay Their Way?
Type: Position
Quote: Compared to a planner that is guaranteed to be correct in a narrow set of domains, LLMs may likely be good at generating plausible (but not guaranteed to be correct) plan heuristics/suggestions in many more scenarios.

Claim 10:
Statement: LLM-Modulo frameworks can improve performance in travel planning.
Location: 4. Two Case Studies of LLM-Modulo
Type: Finding
Quote: Our preliminary results on adapting LLM-Modulo framework to this benchmark are reported in (Gundawar et al., 2024). The benchmark’s authors test LLMs across a variety of prompt engineering techniques including Chain of Thought and ReAct, reporting that–on GPT-3.5-Turbo–the current best strategies only manage a startlingly low 0.7% performance rate!

Evidence:
- Our preliminary results on adapting LLM-Modulo framework to this benchmark show that LLM-Modulo based agentification with automated critics in the loop significantly improves the performance (6x of baselines) even with a limit of 10 back prompting cycles, and weaker models such as GPT-3.5turbo.
