Claim 6:
Statement: The options include vulnerability-reducing measures, avoidance (e.g., disincentivising developments in high-risk areas and addressing existing social vulnerabilities), hard and soft protection (e.g., sea walls, coastal wetlands), accommodation (e.g., elevating houses), advance (e.g., building up and out to sea) and staged, managed retreat (e.g., landward movement of people and development) interventions (very high confidence).

Claim 12:
Statement: Overall, warming will drive range shifts in wetland species (medium to high confidence), but SLR poses the greatest risk for mangroves and salt marshes, with significant losses projected under all future scenarios by mid-century (medium confidence) and substantially greater losses by 2100 under all scenarios except SSP1-1.9 (high confidence).
Location: WGII 3 Ocean and coastal ecosystems and their services 3.4

Claim 16:
Statement: Since AR5 and SRCCL, syntheses have emphasised that the vulnerability of rooted wetland ecosystems to climate-induced drivers is exacerbated by non-climate drivers (high confidence) (Elliott et al., 2019; Ostrowski et al., 2021; Williamson and Guinder, 2021) and climate variability (high confidence) (Day and Rybczyk, 2019; Kendrick et al., 2019; Shields et al., 2019).

Claim 17:
Statement: Without careful management of freshwater inputs, sediment augmentation and/or the restoration of shorelines to more natural states, transformation and loss of intertidal areas and wetland vegetation will increase with SLR (high confidence) (Doughty et al., 2019; Leuven et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019; Raw et al., 2020; Shih, 2020; Stein et al., 2020), with small, shallow microtidal estuaries being more vulnerable to impacts than deeper estuaries with well-developed sediments (medium confidence) (Leuven et al., 2019; Williamson and Guinder, 2021).

Claim 20:
Statement: SR1.5 concluded with high confidence that limiting global warming to 1.5°C, rather than 2°C, will strongly benefit terrestrial and wetland ecosystems and their services, including the cultural services provided by these ecosystems (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018).

Claim 25:
Statement: Appropriately implemented ecosystem-based mitigation, such as reforestation with climate-resilient native species (section 13.3.1.4), peatland and wetland restoration, and agroecology (section 13.5.2), can enhance carbon sequestration or storage (medium confidence) (Seddon et al., 2020).

Claim 26:
Statement: Trade-offs between ecosystem protection, their services and human adaptation and mitigation needs can generate challenges, such as loss of habitats, increased emissions from restored wetlands (Günther et al., 2020) and conflicts between carbon capture services, and provisioning of bioenergy, food, timber and water (medium confidence) (Lee et al., 2019; Krause et al., 2020).

Claim 28:
Statement: While rising sea levels will also directly threaten intertidal and beach ecosystems, coastal wetlands will benefit (medium confidence), in case lateral accommodation space and the opportunity for systems to migrate landward and upwards is provided, enhancing their ability to capture and store carbon (Lecocq et al., 2022; Rogers et al., 2019).

Claim 30:
Statement: Around 2°C GWL, losses accelerate in marine ecosystem and appear across systems, including habitat losses especially in coastal wetlands (Roebeling et al., 2013; Clark et al., 2020), biodiversity and biomass losses (Bryndum-Buchholz et al., 2019; Lotze et al., 2019) and ecosystem services such as fishing (high confidence on the direction of change, but medium confidence on the local and regional magnitude) (Raybaud et al., 2017).

Quote: Other adaptation responses to reduce temperature effects include modifying structures (roofs, engineered materials) and the urban landscape through green infrastructure (e.g., urban trees, wetlands, green roofs), which increases climate resilience and quality of life by reducing urban heat island effects, while additionally improving air quality, capturing stormwater and delivering other co-benefits to the community (e.g., access to food, connection to nature, social connectivity) (high confidence) (see box 14.7; Ballinas and Barradas, 2016; Emilsson and Sang, 2017; Kabisch et al., 2017; Krayenhoff et al., 2018; Petrovic et al., 2019; Schell et al., 2020).
