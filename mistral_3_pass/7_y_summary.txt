Claim 5:
Statement: The utility of audio data, and vocal features, in this important financial prediction task, suggests there exists a significant opportunity to explore the use of audio features in a range of related or complementary tasks (e.g. fraud detection, asset pricing, stock recommendation etc.), where such data is readily available alongside more traditional forms of financial data.
