Claim 42:
Statement: In our work, instead of curating a collection of brief snippets from multiple search engine interactions, we condition GopherCite with a large context with thousands of tokens of uncurated information from multiple pages, focusing GopherCite on reading comprehension, and we specifically investigate how well the model supports individual claims.
