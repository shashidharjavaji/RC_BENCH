Claim 12:
Statement: Based on our experimental results, we identified the optimal multi-agent architectures for various sub-tasks. We demonstrated that an ensemble structure involving multiple agent groups achieves superior performance in investment research tasks, achieving target price prediction with 2.35% avg. diff. and 66.7% accuracy in buy or not decision-making, surpassing all other agent architectures.
