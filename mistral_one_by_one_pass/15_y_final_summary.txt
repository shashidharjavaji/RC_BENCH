However, we still can not completely trust their answer, since LLMs suffer from hallucinationâ€”fabricating non-existent facts to cheat users without perception. And the reasons for their existence and pervasiveness remain unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that nonsense prompts composed of random tokens can also elicit the LLMs to respond with hallucinations."
