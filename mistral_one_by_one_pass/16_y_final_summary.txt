Claim 3:
Statement: Extensive experiments on two tasks - the Domain Query Task (which involved testing 500 XBRL term explanations and 50 domain questions) and the Numeric Type Query Task (tested 1, 000 financial math tests and 50 numeric queries) - demonstrate substantial performance improvements, with accuracy increasing by up to 17% for the domain task and 42% for the numeric type task.
