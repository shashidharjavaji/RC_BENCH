Each ambiguous question was stored as the prompt for the LLM, with ground truth being stored as the expected response from the LLM. The file was formatted as shown below for the 50 questions. Using this, we initiated a fine-tuning job on OpenAI’s fine-tuning API which returned a model checkpoint. We used this fine-tuned model ID instead of gpt-4o-mini within our baseline prompt configuration. “messages”:\n“role”: “user”, “content”: <ambiguous question>, \n“role”: “assistant”, “content”: <ground truth answer>”\nThe GT Answer Overlap for the 4o-mini model is 0.643 while that for the fine-tuned 4o-mini model is 0.626.
