=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: Most LLMs struggle to faithfully translate natural language instructions into grounded states (objects, object states, and relations) in the environment.

Claim 2:
Statement: A common error is generating intermediate goals instead of final goals, e.g., predicting the state open(freezer) for the task “drinking water”.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Statement: Another common error is omitting conversationally uncommon spatial relationship goals. For example, in the task “serving a meal”, with ground truth goal condition ontop(chicken.0, plate.2) and ontop(plate.2, table.1), GPT-4o mistakenly predicts ontop(chicken.0, table.1), ignoring the crucial spatial relationship between the chicken, plate, and table.

Claim 4:
Statement: Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves the highest overall goal interpretation performance (F1-score) in both VirtualHome and BEHAVIOR simulators, while Claude-3 Opus has the highest successful ground truth goal retrieval rate (Recall) in both simulators. For example, in the VirtualHome simulator, Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves an F1-score of 82.0%, and Claude-3 Opus achieves a Recall of 89.1%.

Claim 5:
Statement: State-of-the-art proprietary LLMs make few to no grammar errors, while top open-source LLMs like Llama 3 70B Instruct suffer more from format/parsing errors and object/state hallucination. For instance, GPT-4o makes no parsing errors in both simulators, while Llama 3 8B makes parsing errors in 0.6% of cases in VirtualHome and 2.0% in BEHAVIOR.

Claim 6:
Statement: Reasoning ability is a crucial aspect that LLMs should improve. As shown in Fig 3 in the main paper, trajectory runtime errors are common (41.2%), with a large portion of missing step (15.5%) and additional step (16.2%) errors, often due to overlooking preconditions. For instance, LLMs may ignore the agent’s sitting or lying state and fail to include a standup action before executing other actions. They sometimes also fail to understand the need to open a closed object before fetching items from inside. Additional step errors frequently occur when LLMs output actions for previously achieved goals.

Claim 7:
Statement: In BEHAVIOR, o1-preview leads with the highest task success rate (81.0%) and execution success rate (91.0%), followed by o1-mini in second place (56.0%, 65.0%). The best non-o1-series model is GPT-4o (47.0%, 53.0%). Notably and interestingly, in VirtualHome, Mistral Large (73.4%,83.6%) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (73.1%, 83.3%) both outperform o1-preview (71.1%, 78.4%).

Claim 8:
Statement: Better LLMs generally make fewer grammar errors compared to less advanced models. For example, Claude-3 Opus makes no parsing errors in both simulators, while GPT3.5-turbo makes parsing errors in 4.0% of cases in BEHAVIOR.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 9:
Statement: The most common runtime errors are missing steps and wrong order in both simulators. For instance, in BEHAVIOR, GPT-4o encounters missing step errors in 36.0% of cases and wrong order errors in 9.0% of cases.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 10:
Statement: LLMs perform better in satisfying state goals than relation goals and struggle with complex action goals. For example, in VirtualHome, GPT-4o achieves a state goal success rate of 82.0% but a relation task success rate of 67.8%.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 11:
Statement: Task complexity, including the number of goals, state goals, relation goals, and action sequence length, adversely affects the task success rate. For instance, in BEHAVIOR, the success rate drops from around 60% for tasks with fewer than 5 goals to below 40% for tasks with more than 10 goals.

Claim 13:

In VirtualHome, Gemini 1.5 Flash and Claude-3.5 Sonnet also exhibit high performance with success rates of 89.1%.
