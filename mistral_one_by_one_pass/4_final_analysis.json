Prior work creates evaluations with crowdwork (which is time-consuming and expensive) or existing data sources (which are not always available). Here, we automatically generate evaluations with LMs. We explore approaches with varying amounts of human effort, from instructing LMs to write yes/no questions to making complex Winogender schemas with multiple stages of LM-based generation and filtering. Crowdworkers rate the examples as highly relevant and agree with 90-100% of labels, sometimes more so than corresponding human-written datasets. We generate 154 datasets and discover new cases of inverse scaling where LMs get worse with size. Larger LMs repeat back a dialog user\u2019s preferred answer (\u201csycophancy\u201d) and express greater desire to pursue concerning goals like resource acquisition and goal preservation. We also find some of the first examples of inverse scaling in RL from Human Feedback (RLHF), where more RLHF makes LMs worse. For example, RLHF makes LMs express stronger political views (on gun rights and immigration) and a greater desire to avoid shut down. Overall, LM-written evaluations are high-quality and let us quickly discover many novel LM behaviors.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"claim_id\": 2,\n            \"claim_text\": \"The authors show that LM-written evaluations can be used to discover new cases of inverse scaling where larger LMs are worse than smaller ones.\",\n            \"location\": \"Abstract\",\n            \"claim_type\": \"Result\",\n            \"exact_quote\": \"We discover several new cases of \u201cinverse scaling\u201d (Lin et al., 2021; McKenzie et al., 2022) where larger LMs are worse than smaller ones.
