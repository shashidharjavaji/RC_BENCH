Consequently, agents now have two jobs: conversing and planning/reasoning. Their conversational responses must be informed by all available information, and their actions must help to achieve goals. This dichotomy between conversing with the user and doing multi-step reasoning and planning can be seen as analogous to the human systems of \u201cthinking fast and slow\u201d as introduced by Kahneman [14]. Our approach is comprised of a \\\"Talker\\\" agent (System 1) that is fast and intuitive, and tasked with synthesizing the conversational response; and a \\\"Reasoner\\\" agent (System 2) that is slower, more deliberative, and more logical, and is tasked with multi-step reasoning and planning, calling tools, performing actions in the world, and thereby producing the new agent state. We describe the new Talker-Reasoner architecture and discuss its advantages, including modularity and decreased latency.
