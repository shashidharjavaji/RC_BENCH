Claim 1:
Type: contribution
Statement: We develop a stylometric analysis method based on LISA (Patel et al., 2023) and LDA to facilitate the analysis of writing styles of persona-assigned LLMs.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: We develop a stylometric analysis method based on LISA (Patel et al., 2023) and LDA to facilitate the analysis of writing styles of persona-assigned LLMs.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We use an interpretable style embedding model called LISA (Patel et al., 2023) and propose an LDA-based method to derive eight coarse-grained styles from the original 768 style attributes produced by LISA.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Method for Stylometric Analysis
  Limitations: The method's interpretability and the choice of 8 styles are based on manual inspection and may not be universally applicable.
  Exact Quote: We use an interpretable style embedding model called LISA (Patel et al., 2023) and propose an LDA-based method to derive eight coarse-grained styles from the original 768 style attributes produced by LISA.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The method is well-supported by the use of interpretable models and manual inspection.
Key Limitations: The method's interpretability and the choice of 8 styles are based on manual inspection and may not be universally applicable.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: We empirically analyze the writing styles of three popular LLMs when they are assigned different personas, and compare them with those of real Reddit comments.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: We empirically analyze the writing styles of three popular LLMs when they are assigned different personas, and compare them with those of real Reddit comments.

Evidence:

  Strength: strong
  Location: Method for Stylometric Analysis
  Limitations: The choice of LLMs may not be representative of all possible LLMs.
