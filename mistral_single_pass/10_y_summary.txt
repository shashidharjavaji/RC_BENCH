Claim 1:
Type: methodology
Statement: Multimodal-CoT incorporates language and vision modalities into a two-stage framework that separates rationale generation and answer inference.
Location: Section 4
Exact Quote: Multimodal-CoT consists of two operation stages: (i) rationale generation and (ii) answer inference.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The rationale generation stage feeds the model with language and vision inputs to generate rationales.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: In the rationale generation stage, we feed the model with X = {Xlanguage[1] _[, X][vision][}][ where][ X]language[1]_ [represents] the language input in the first stage and Xvision represents the vision input, i.e., the image.

- Evidence Text: The answer inference stage appends the rationale to the original language input and feeds the updated input to the model to infer the final answer.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: In the answer inference stage, the rationale R is appended to the original language input Xlanguage[1] [to construct] the language input in the second stage, Xlanguage[2] [=][ X]language[1] _[, X][vision][}][ to the model to infer the final answer.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The methodology is clearly described and supported by specific examples and steps.
Key Limitations: None
