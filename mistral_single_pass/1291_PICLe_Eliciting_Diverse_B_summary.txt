Claim 1:
Type: performance
Statement: PICLe consistently outperforms all baselines on three LLMs with respect to Action Consistency.
Location: Section 4.3
Exact Quote: PICLe consistently outperforms all baselines on three LLMs with respect to Action Consistency.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: On Llama-2, PICLe achieves an average action consistency of 88.1%, outperforming the current strongest baseline similarity (84.6%) using the same number of in-context examples (K = 3).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: On Llama-2, PICLe achieves an average action consistency of 88.1%, outperforming the current strongest baseline similarity (84.6%) using the same number of in-context examples (K = 3).

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported by concrete experimental results showing that PICLe outperforms other baselines in terms of action consistency.
Key Limitations: None

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 2:
Type: performance
Statement: PICLe helps non-RLHF models.
Location: Section 4.3
Exact Quote: PICLe helps non-RLHF models.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Without ICL, GPT-J completely fails to follow instructions of responding ‘yes’ or ‘no’, making it impossible to report any meaningful performances. Vicuna, on the other hand, consistently outputs the same response across different statements, with high confidence. This behavior accounts for Vicuna’s Action Consistency of around 50% with near-zero standard deviations.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: None

Claim 3:
Type: methodology
Statement: PICLe is not sensitive to the number of epochs used for Persona SFT.
Location: Section 5.3
Exact Quote: PICLe is not sensitive to the number of epochs used for Persona SFT.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The performance does not change significantly with different number of epochs, which is an advantage in terms of hyperparameter tuning. Notably, 1 epoch of Persona SFT is enough to outperform the best baseline method on Llama-2 in Table 1, i.e., the Similarity baseline with 84.6% Action Consistency.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.3
  Limitations: None

Claim 4:
Type: performance
Statement: PICLe is the only method that outperforms the Random ICL baseline with 71.0% Action Consistency.
Location: Section 4.3
Exact Quote: PICLe is the only method that outperforms the Random ICL baseline with 71.0% Action Consistency.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: On a bigger Llama-2 model, ‘Llama-2-13bchat-hf’, PICLe achieves the best performance in terms of Action Consistency, and tends to respond to queries with less uncertainty and high confidence. Also, it is noteworthy that PICLe is the only method that outperforms the Random ICL baseline with 71.0% Action Consistency.
