Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: The visual prompt dependency measure decreases as more tokens are generated, making the generations more likely to be hallucinated.
Location: Section 3
Exact Quote: We propose to study hallucinations on VLMs using PDMs defined as follows...

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The influence of the image over the next token prediction decreases as we generate more.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3
  Limitations: The study is limited to synthetic captions generated by LLaVA on MS COCO’s validation split.
  Exact Quote: We see that the influence of the image over the next token prediction decreases as we generate more.

- Evidence Text: The number of non-existent objects present on the same synthetic captions as a function of the number of generated tokens.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3
  Limitations: The study is limited to synthetic captions generated by LLaVA on MS COCO’s validation split.
  Exact Quote: Note that very few objects are hallucinated for tokens near the visual prompt, while their number increases as more tokens are generated and with a smaller PDM.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence directly shows that the visual prompt dependency measure decreases as more tokens are generated, leading to more hallucinations.
Key Limitations: The study is limited to synthetic captions generated by LLaVA on MS COCO’s validation split.
