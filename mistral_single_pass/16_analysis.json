Finally, we investigate whether EUREKA can be used to solve a truly novel and challenging dexterous task. To this end, we propose pen spinning as a test bed. This task is highly dynamic and requires a Shadow Hand to continuously rotate a pen to achieve some pre-defined spinning patterns for as many cycles as possible; we implement this task on top of the original Shadow Hand environment in Isaac Gym without changes to any physics parameter, ensuring physical realism. We consider a curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009) approach to break down the task into manageable components that can be independently solved by EUREKA. Specifically, we first use EUREKA to generate a reward for the task of re-orienting the pen to random target configurations and train a policy using the final EUREKA reward. Then, using this pre-trained policy (Pre-Trained), we fine-tune it using the same EUREKA reward to reach the sequence of pen-spinning configurations (Fine-Tuned). To demonstrate the importance of curriculum learning, we also directly train a policy from scratch on the target task using EUREKA reward without the first-stage pre-training (Scratch). The RL training curves are shown in Figure 7. Eureka fine-tuning quickly adapts the policy to successfully spin the pen for many cycles in a row; see project website for videos. In contrast, neither pre-trained or learning-from-scratch policies can complete even a single cycle of pen spinning.",
