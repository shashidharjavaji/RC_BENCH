Claim 1:
Type: contribution
Statement: The Audio-Visual LLM framework synergistically aligns visual and audio signals for holistic video understanding.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: To this end, we hereby introduce a multimodal LLM framework that synergistically aligns visual and audio signals for holistic video understanding.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The framework includes two key contributions. First, we implement a modality augmentation approach during the training of the AudioVisual LLM. This technique facilitates a comprehensive exploration of the interplay between visual and audio signals in videos.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: First, we implement a modality augmentation approach during the training of the AudioVisual LLM. This technique facilitates a comprehensive exploration of the interplay between visual and audio signals in videos.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported by the detailed description of the modality augmentation approach and its purpose.
Key Limitations: None

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: The modality-augmented training strategy enables end-to-end joint training with video data across different modalities, including visual-only, audio-only, and audio-visual formats.
Location: Methods
Exact Quote: We hereby propose a novel training paradigm, termed Modality-Augmented Training (MAT), to jointly train three modal types of samples (i.e., visual-only, audio-only, and audio-visual joint samples) within a single batch.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: This paradigm allows our model to simultaneously consider multiple perspectives of video, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of its content.
  Strength: strong

Claim 3:
Type: contribution
Statement: The high-quality video instruction dataset derived from GPT-4 enables the Audio-Visual LLM to adeptly process a variety of task-oriented video instructions.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: We introduce a high-quality video instruction dataset, derived from GPT-4. This dataset allows Audio-Visual LLM to adeptly process a variety of task-oriented video instructions, ranging from multi-turn conversations and audio-visual narratives to complex reasoning tasks.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The dataset includes 260k instruction data pairs from audio, visual, and audio-visual samples, encompassing 100k detailed audio-visual descriptions, 120k multi-turn conversations, and 40k complex reasoning.
  Strength: strong
