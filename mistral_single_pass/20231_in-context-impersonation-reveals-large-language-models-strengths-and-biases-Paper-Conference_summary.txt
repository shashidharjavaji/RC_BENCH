Claim 1:
Type: contribution
Statement: In-context impersonation can change the performance and reveal biases of LLMs.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: We presented evidence that in-context impersonation, that is asking LLMs to take on different roles in context, can change their performance and reveal their biases.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: In a two-armed bandit task, LLMs impersonating children of different ages can recover human-like developmental stages of exploration.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: The study only considers a limited range of personas and tasks.
  Exact Quote: In the bandit task, for every age group that the LLM impersonates, we perform 2k two-armed bandit games of 10 trials each for each prompt variation.

- Evidence Text: In a language-based reasoning task, LLMs impersonating domain experts perform better than LLMs impersonating non-domain experts.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: The study only considers a limited range of tasks and experts.
  Exact Quote: In our reasoning task, the LLM has to answer a multiple-choice question regarding a given topic from the Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) dataset.

- Evidence Text: In a vision-language task, impersonation can improve performance and reveal societal biases.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: The study only considers a limited range of classes and personas.
  Exact Quote: We ask the LLMs to generate a description of a class, from the perspective of a persona.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The study provides strong evidence from multiple tasks and personas, demonstrating the impact of in-context impersonation.
Key Limitations: The study is limited to a specific range of tasks and personas, and the results may not generalize to all scenarios.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: In-context impersonation can recover human-like developmental stages of exploration.
Location: Section 4.1
Exact Quote: In the bandit task, for every age group that the LLM impersonates, we perform 2k two-armed bandit games of 10 trials each for each prompt variation.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The LLM obtains a higher average reward as it impersonates older personas.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: The study only considers a limited range of ages and tasks.
  Exact Quote: With an increasing number of trials, the LLM obtains a higher average reward, corroborating that Vicuna-13B is able to learn from past trials to improve its policy similarly to GPT-3 in [8].

- Evidence Text: The LLM's exploration and exploitation strategies change with age.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1
  Limitations: The study only considers a limited range of ages and tasks.
  Exact Quote: We find that the impersonating LLMs generally improved over trials, i.e. they increase their rewards as they progress over trials of a game.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The study provides strong evidence from multiple tasks and personas, demonstrating the impact of in-context impersonation.
Key Limitations: The study is limited to a specific range of ages and tasks, and the results may not generalize to all scenarios.

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: In-context impersonation can improve performance in language-based reasoning tasks.
Location: Section 4.2
Exact Quote: In our reasoning task, the LLM has to answer a multiple-choice question regarding a given topic from the Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) dataset.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: LLMs impersonating domain experts perform better than LLMs impersonating non-domain experts.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: The study only considers a limited range of tasks and experts.
  Exact Quote: In Figure 3 (top row), as expected, when the LLM is asked to impersonate the task expert, the performance is the highest.

- Evidence Text: The performance in the Humanities tasks is higher than the accuracy in the other domain tasks.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: The study only considers a limited range of tasks and experts.
  Exact Quote: In Figure 3 (top row), as expected, when the LLM is asked to impersonate the task expert, the performance is the highest.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The study provides strong evidence from multiple tasks and experts, demonstrating the impact of in-context impersonation.
Key Limitations: The study is limited to a specific range of tasks and experts, and the results may not generalize to all scenarios.

Claim 4:
Type: result
Statement: In-context impersonation can reveal societal biases about a personâ€™s age, gender, and race.
Location: Section 4.3
Exact Quote: In a vision-language task, impersonation can improve performance and reveal societal biases.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: LLMs impersonating a black person or a male describe cars better, while LLMs impersonating a white person or a female describe birds better.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: The study only considers a limited range of classes and personas.
  Exact Quote: In Figure 4, we observe the effects of age, expertise, ethnicity, and gender independent of the VLM used for fine-grained visual classification.

- Evidence Text: The language encoder of VLMs potentially being weaker than Vicuna, we expect these results to improve overall with a stronger language encoder in the VLM but this is an orthogonal direction to explore.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4.3
  Limitations: The study only considers a limited range of classes and personas.
  Exact Quote: The language encoder of VLMs potentially being weaker than Vicuna, we expect these results to improve overall with a stronger language encoder in the VLM but this is an orthogonal direction to explore.

Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The study provides strong evidence from multiple tasks and personas, demonstrating the impact of in-context impersonation.
