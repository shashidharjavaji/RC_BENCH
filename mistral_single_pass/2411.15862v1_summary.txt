Claim 1:
Type: contribution
Statement: Implicit CoT does not equal explicit CoT.
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: It has been well-known that Chain-of-Thought can remarkably enhance LLMs’ performance on complex tasks. However, because it also introduces slower inference speeds and higher computational costs, many researches have attempted to use implicit CoT, which does not need LLMs to explicitly generate the intermediate steps. But there is still a gap between their efficacy and typical explicit CoT methods. This leaves us a doubt that, does implicit CoT really equal to explicit CoT?

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The results surprisingly indicate that LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Abstract
  Limitations: The study is limited to arithmetic problems and may not generalize to other types of reasoning tasks.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported by experimental evidence showing that LLMs do not calculate intermediate steps in implicit reasoning.
Key Limitations: The study is limited to arithmetic problems and may not generalize to other types of reasoning tasks.

Claim 2:

Statement: Implicit reasoning is less reliable and unstable.
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: Moreover, we find LLMs’ implicit reasoning capabilities are susceptible and unstable, reaffirming the necessity of explicit CoT to effectively support complex tasks.
