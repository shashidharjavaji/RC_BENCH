Claim 2:
Type: contribution
Statement: Three sources of bad annotations, both malicious and otherwise, can corrupt the reliability of open leaderboard rankings.
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: In this paper, we demonstrate that three sources of bad annotations, both malicious and otherwise, can corrupt the reliability of open leaderboard rankings.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The paper discusses three sources of poor-quality votes: apathetic, adversarial, and arbitrary.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Abstract
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: In this paper, we demonstrate that three sources of bad annotations, both malicious and otherwise, can corrupt the reliability of open leaderboard rankings.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported by the discussion of three specific sources of poor-quality votes.
Key Limitations: None

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: Only 10% of poor quality votes by apathetic or adversarial annotators can change the rankings of models by up to 5 places on the leaderboard.
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: In particular, we show that only 10% of poor quality votes by apathetic or adversarial annotators can change the rankings of models by up to 5 places on the leaderboard.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 1 shows that 10% of apathetic votes can change the leaderboard rankings of 2/3 models by 5 places.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Abstract
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Table 1 summarizes our results. We find that only 10% of apathetic votes in the dataset can change the leaderboard rankings of 2/3 models by 5 places.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported by experimental results showing the impact of apathetic votes on model rankings.
Key Limitations: None

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 4:
Type: methodology
Statement: The main attraction of open community platforms for end users is that they expose a free and easy-to-use API endpoint for LLMs.
Location: Section 3.1
Exact Quote: The main attraction of open community platforms for end users is that they expose a free and easy-to-use API endpoint for LLMs.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The paper discusses the incentives for users to interact with the platform and submit queries.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3.1
  Limitations: The claim is based on general observations and does not provide specific data.
  Exact Quote: The main attraction of open community platforms for end users is that they expose a free and easy-to-use API endpoint for LLMs.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is supported by the discussion of user incentives to interact with the platform.
Key Limitations: The claim is based on general observations and does not provide specific data.

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 5:
Type: result
Statement: Adversarial voting can change leaderboard rankings if adversaries get to contribute 10% votes for their model.
Location: Section 3.2
Exact Quote: Table 2 summarizes our results. Across all models, we show that adversarial attacks can substantially change leaderboard rankings if adversaries get to contribute 10% votes for their model.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Table 2 shows that adversarial attacks can change leaderboard rankings if adversaries get to contribute 10% votes for their model.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.2
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: Table 2 summarizes our results. Across all models, we show that adversarial attacks can substantially change leaderboard rankings if adversaries get to contribute 10% votes for their model.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported by experimental results showing the impact of adversarial votes on model rankings.
Key Limitations: None

--------------------------------------------------

Claim 6:
Type: contribution
Statement: Arbitrary votes are not 'noise' and provide useful signals about models' relative performance.
Location: Section 3.3
Exact Quote: We argue that arbitrary votes are not 'noise' and provide useful signals about models' relative performance.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The paper discusses the usefulness of arbitrary votes in providing signals about models' relative performance.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: The claim is based on general observations and does not provide specific data.
  Exact Quote: We argue that arbitrary votes are not 'noise' and provide useful signals about models' relative performance.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is supported by the discussion of the usefulness of arbitrary votes.
Key Limitations: The claim is based on general observations and does not provide specific data.
