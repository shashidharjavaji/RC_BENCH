Claim 1:
Type: contribution
Statement: There is growing evidence that changes in speech and language may be early markers of dementia, but much of the previous NLP work in this area has been limited by the size of the available datasets.
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: There is growing evidence that changes in speech and language may be early markers of dementia, but much of the previous NLP work in this area has been limited by the size of the available datasets.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The study compares several methods of domain adaptation to augment a small French dataset of picture descriptions (n = 57) with a much larger English dataset (n = 550), for the task of automatically distinguishing participants with dementia from controls.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Abstract
  Limitations: Limited to the specific datasets used.

Claim 2:
Type: methodology
Statement: The first challenge is to identify a set of features that transfer across languages; in addition to previously used features based on information units, we introduce a new set of features to model the order in which information units are produced by dementia patients and controls.
