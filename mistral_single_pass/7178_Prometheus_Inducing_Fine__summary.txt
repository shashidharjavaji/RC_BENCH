Claim 1:
Type: contribution
Statement: PROMETHEUS, a 13B evaluator LLM, can assess any given long-form text based on customized score rubrics provided by the user.
Location: Abstract
Exact Quote: We propose PROMETHEUS, a 13B evaluator LLM that can assess any given long-form text based on customized score rubrics provided by the user.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: PROMETHEUS obtains a Pearson correlation of 0.897 with human evaluators when evaluating with 45 customized score rubrics, which is on par with GPT-4 (0.882), and greatly outperforms ChatGPT (0.392).
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5.1
  Limitations: None
  Exact Quote: PROMETHEUS obtains a Pearson correlation of 0.897 with human evaluators when evaluating with 45 customized score rubrics, which is on par with GPT-4 (0.882), and greatly outperforms ChatGPT (0.392).

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
