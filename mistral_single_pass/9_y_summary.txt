Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: Multimodal neurons can be found within the transformer, and they are active in response to particular image semantics.
Location: 2. Multimodal Neurons
Exact Quote: We show that multimodal neurons also emerge when vision and language are learned entirely separately, and convert visual representations aligned to a frozen language model into text.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: We analyze text transformer neurons in the multimodal LiMBeR model, where a linear layer trained on CC3M casts BEIT image embeddings into the input space of GPT-J 6B.
  Strength: strong
  Location: 2. Multimodal Neurons
  Limitations: The analysis is specific to the LiMBeR-BEIT model and may not generalize to other models.
  Exact Quote: We analyze text transformer neurons in the multimodal LiMBeR model, where a linear layer trained on CC3M casts BEIT image embeddings into the input space of GPT-J 6B.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported by the specific analysis of the LiMBeR-BEIT model, which demonstrates the presence of multimodal neurons.
Key Limitations: The findings may not generalize to other multimodal models.

Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Multimodal neurons causally affect output: modulating them can remove concepts from image captions.
Location: 3. Experiments
Exact Quote: Ablating multimodal neurons also leads to significant changes in the semantics of GPT-generated captions.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: When up to 6400 random units are ablated, we find that the probability of token c is largely unaffected, but ablating the same number of top-scoring units decreases token probability by 80% on average.
  Strength: strong
  Location: 3.3. Do multimodal neurons causally affect output?
  Limitations: The experiment is specific to the LiMBeR-BEIT model and may not generalize to other models.
  Exact Quote: When up to 6400 random units are ablated, we find that the probability of token c is largely unaffected, but ablating the same number of top-scoring units decreases token probability by 80% on average.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The claim is supported by the experimental results showing that ablating multimodal neurons significantly affects the semantics of generated captions.
Key Limitations: The findings may not generalize to other multimodal models.

Claim 3:
Type: contribution
Statement: The capacity to align representations across modalities could underlie the utility of language models as general-purpose interfaces for tasks involving sequential modeling.
Location: 4. Conclusion
Exact Quote: The capacity to align representations across modalities could underlie the utility of language models as general-purpose interfaces for tasks involving sequential modeling.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Understanding the roles of individual computational units can serve as a starting point for investigating how transformers generalize across tasks.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: 4. Conclusion
  Limitations: The claim is speculative and based on the potential utility of language models.
  Exact Quote: Understanding the roles of individual computational units can serve as a starting point for investigating how transformers generalize across tasks.
