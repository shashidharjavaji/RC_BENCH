  Strength: strong
  Location: 3 ADVERSARIAL ATTACK INDUCES HALLUCINATION
  Limitations: The paper does not provide specific limitations for this claim.
  Quote: we automatically induce LLMs to respond with non-existent facts via hallucination attack from two distinct directions, i) semantics preserved prompt perturbation, and ii) no-sense OoD prompt; with gradient-base adversarial attack we could construct both two categories of adversarial prompt triggering hallucination.
