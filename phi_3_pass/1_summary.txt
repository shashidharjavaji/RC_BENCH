Claim 6:
Statement: The behavior of a trained model depends on both the training set and the model’s architecture.
Location: Discussion
Type: Analysis
Quote: The behavior of a trained model depends on both the training set and the model’s architecture.

Evidence:
- The behavior of a trained model depends on both the training set and the model’s architecture.

==================================================

Claim 7:
Statement: The models’ poor results are due in large part to insufficient signal from the MNLI training set, rather than the models’ representational capacities alone.
Location: Discussion
Type: Analysis
Quote: The fact that SPINN did markedly better at the subsequence cases than ESIM and DA, even though the three models were trained on the same dataset, suggests that MNLI does contain some signal that can counteract the appeal of the syntactic heuristics tested by HANS.

Evidence:
- The models’ poor results are due in large part to insufficient signal from the MNLI training set, rather than the models’ representational capacities alone.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Discussion
  Limitations: Based on the authors' interpretation of the results
  Quote: The models’ poor results are due in large part to insufficient signal from the MNLI training set, rather than the models’ representational capacities alone.

Justified: True
