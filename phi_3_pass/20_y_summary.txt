=== Paper Analysis Summary ===

Claim 1:
Statement: propose a static method for pinpointing significant neurons
Location: Abstract
Type: Methodology
Quote: In this paper, we propose a static method for pinpointing significant neurons.

Evidence:
- We propose a static method for locating significant neurons.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.3
  Limitations: The study focuses on six specific types of knowledge, and it's essential to compare the similarities and differences in knowledge storage across different models.
  Quote: In this section, we introduce the background in Section 3.1, and analyze the distribution change caused by neurons and introduce our proposed method for locating the 'value neurons' that contribute to the final predictions directly in Section 3.3.

- We also develop a static method to identify 'query neurons' that activate these 'value neurons'.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 3.4
  Limitations: The study focuses on six specific types of knowledge, and it's essential to compare the similarities and differences in knowledge storage across different models.
  Quote: Furthermore, since the identified neurons usually directly contribute to the final predictions, we also design a static method to identify the 'query neurons' activating these 'value neurons'.

Claim 2:
Statement: demonstrates superior performance across three metrics
Location: Abstract
Type: Methodology
Quote: our approach demonstrates superior performance across three metrics.
