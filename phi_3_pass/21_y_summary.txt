  Limitations: None mentioned
  Quote: To clarify the main concepts in our framework, we provide the following key notions: QR Neuron is an individual neuron highly correlated with a specific query, capable of influencing the corresponding knowledge expression. Our primary objective is to identify a set of QR neurons for a given input. QR Cluster represents a coarse grouping of neurons associated with a specific query.

  Limitations: None mentioned
  Quote: To extend our methodology to Gated Linear Units (GLUs), which comprise two linear transformations followed by a gating mechanism, we adapt the Knowledge Attribution approach.

  Strength: strong

  Limitations: None mentioned
  Quote: We observe that some neurons with a relatively high attribution score are still shared across clusters. Through case studies (as shown in Table 4), we demonstrate that they express commonly used concepts such as option letters (‘‘A’’ and ‘‘B’’) or stop words (‘‘and’’ and ‘‘the’’).

Claim 10:
Statement: QRNCA identifies domain-specific knowledge regions in the middle layers of LLMs.
Location: 5 Analyzing Detected QR Neurons
Type: Novel Finding
Quote: Based on prior studies, LLMs process and represent information in a hierarchical manner (Geva et al. 2022; Wendler et al. 2024; Tang et al. 2024). The early layers are primarily responsible for extracting low-level features, while the middle layers begin to integrate this information, forming more complex semantic representations. The late layers are typically dedicated to generating the final output. Therefore, we suppose that domain-specific knowledge representation is built in the middle layer and the top layers are then mainly responsible for next-token prediction, which may explain the visible regions for different subject domains.

None

Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: None mentioned explicitly, but general limitations of LLMs and methodologies apply.

Quote: Regarding layer distribution, the QR neurons are predominantly located in the middle layers (15-18) and the top layers (around 30), as depicted in Figure 2b. This finding indicates knowledge concepts are mainly stored in the middle and top layers, and we may only modify these neurons for efficient knowledge updating (Ding et al. 2023).

Limitations: None mentioned explicitly, but general limitations of LLMs and methodologies apply.
