Claim 1:
Statement: Simple, training-free, token-level disambiguation methods may be effectively used to improve LLM performance for ambiguous question answering tasks.
Location: Abstract
Type: Nature of the claim
Quote: We demonstrate how simple, training-free, token-level disambiguation methods may be effectively used to improve LLM performance for ambiguous question answering tasks.

Evidence:
- We demonstrate how simple, training-free, token-level disambiguation methods may be effectively used to improve LLM performance for ambiguous question answering tasks.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Abstract
  Limitations: None mentioned directly for this claim
  Quote: We demonstrate how simple, training-free, token-level disambiguation methods may be effectively used to improve LLM performance for ambiguous question answering tasks.

- Out of the two simple disambiguating methods explored, we see that disambiguation via adding context performs better for both LLMs.
  Strength: moderate

  Limitations: None mentioned directly for this claim
  Quote: Out of the two simple disambiguating methods explored, we see that disambiguation via adding context performs better for both LLMs.

- We show the results for RQ1 for GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini in Tables I and II respectively. In both tables, Question coherence refers to the semantic similarity between the ground truth disambiguated question and the ambiguous question when disambiguated via the LLM following one of the two methods; Naive Answer Overlap refers to the semantic similarity between LLM responses obtained via the disambiguating prompts vs. the naive prompt; and finally GT Answer Overlap refers to the semantic similarity between the LLM response and the ground truth answer in the dataset. Ideally, we want higher values for this metric. Interestingly, we see that for both GPT 4o and 4o-mini, using simple disambiguating prompts improves performance over the naive setting, implying that simple prompt-based, training-free approaches may be useful in improving LLM performance for ambiguous queries.
