Claim 3:
Statement: LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning.
Location: Abstract
Type: Study Finding
Quote: LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning.

Evidence:

  Strength: strong
  Location: Results
  Limitations: The study suggests a lack of step-by-step reasoning but does not directly measure reliance on experience.

Location: Conclusion
Type: Conclusion
Quote: Implicit reasoning may just be an illusion created by LLMs’ powerful memory and rich experience, which is fundamentally different from conventional reasoning.

Evidence:
- implicit reasoning may just be an illusion created by LLMs’ powerful memory and rich experience.
  Strength: moderate

Claim 6:
Statement: implicit reasoning does not follow a step-by-step process but just intuitively thinks of the answer.
Location: Conclusion
Type: Conclusion
Quote: implicit reasoning does not follow a step-by-step process but just intuitively thinks of the answer.

Evidence:
- the model may not strictly follow a step-by-step reasoning process, but relies solely on an intuitive and direct way of thinking to complete the task.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Results
  Limitations: The study infers this from the lack of intermediate step calculation but does not directly observe the reasoning process.

Type: Conclusion
Quote: LLMs, despite they can often directly give the correct answer of a multistep problem, especially when with a larger size, they are not really doing step-by-step reasoning.

Evidence:
- implicit reasoning does not follow a step-by-step process but just intuitively thinks of the answer.
  Strength: strong
