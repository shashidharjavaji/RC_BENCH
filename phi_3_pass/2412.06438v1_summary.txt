- Performance tends to decrease as environmental complexity increases.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1: EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLEXITY ON EXPLORATION
  Limitations: None provided.
  Quote: We first examine the effect of varying the amount and type of environmental complexity on strategic exploration and performance. We evaluate the 2 Gemini models’ performance in both single-feature and conjunction tasks. We benchmark against an optimal baseline (upper bound) and random baselines with and without replacement (lower bounds assuming perfect memory and no memory, respectively), and evaluated the optimal and random policies on 1000 episodes and the Gemini models on 200 episodes.

- Gemini’s information gathering capability is close to optimal for single-feature-based rewards.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1: EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLEXITY ON EXPLORATION
  Limitations: None provided.
  Quote: For single-feature-based rewards, we find that smaller models curiously perform better; for conjunction-based rewards, incorporating self-correction into the model improves performance.

- Performance is comparable in both text and 3D embodied environments.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.1: EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLEXITY ON EXPLORATION
  Limitations: Performance is comparable in both text and 3D embodied environments, although imperfect visual object recognition reduces its accuracy in drawing conclusions from gathered information in the 3D embodied case.

- Incorporating self-correction into the model improves performance for conjunction-based rewards.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2: EFFECTS OF PROMPTING AND CONTEXT LENGTH
  Limitations: None provided.
  Quote: For conjunction tasks, self-correction appears more effective in more complex tasks, either performing comparably, or slightly outperforming the base model.

- The hit in performance is due partly to the model translating task description to a policy and partly to the model’s effectiveness in using its in-context memory.

  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 5: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
  Limitations: None provided.
  Quote: The directed exploration capabilities of foundation models robustly generalize from text-based environments to embodied 3D environments, though overall accuracy of the system is somewhat reduced by imperfect performance of the VLM’s object and action recognition in videos.

- The challenges of multi-modal reasoning from realistic simulated video could be addressed by focusing on the vision and action recognition capabilities of foundation models separately from their reasoning capabilities.
  Strength: strong
