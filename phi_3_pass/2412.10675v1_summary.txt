Claim 1:
Statement: Fine-tuning LLMs on a corpus of planning instances does not lead to robust planning skills, as indicated by poor performance on out-of-distribution test sets.
Location: Abstract
Type: Nature of the claim
Quote: Fine-tuning LLMs on a corpus of planning instances does not lead to robust planning skills, as indicated by poor performance on out-of-distribution test sets.

Evidence:
- The fine-tuned LLM struggles to generalize to OOD cases, unable to generate either valid or executable plans.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: The study does not explore the impact of different fine-tuning datasets or the potential for fine-tuning on a more diverse set of planning problems.
  Quote: The fine-tuned model utterly failed to perform in the 'unseen' and 'obfuscated' test sets, unable to generate either valid or executable plans.

- The fine-tuned model achieves high performance across all domains in in-distribution tests, but struggles with longer and more complex planning scenarios.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section 4.2
  Limitations: The study does not explore the impact of different fine-tuning datasets or the potential for fine-tuning on a more diverse set of planning problems.
  Quote: Previous studies have asserted the effectiveness of finetuning LLMs for plan generation (Rossetti et al. 2024; Shah et al. 2024). We revisit this claim, examining whether the statements hold true in our extended PlanBench dataset. Our results refute the claim that fine-tuning alone enables LLMs to master complex planning.

Conclusion:
Justified: True
Robustness: high
Limitations: The study only evaluates the model's performance on the extended PlanBench dataset, which may not cover all possible planning scenarios.
Confidence: high
