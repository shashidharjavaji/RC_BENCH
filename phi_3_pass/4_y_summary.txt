Claim 1:
Statement: We surmise that existing unimodal encoders pre-trained on large amounts of unimodal data should provide an effective bootstrap to create multimodal models from unimodal ones at much lower costs.
Location: Abstract
Type: Hypothesis
Quote: We surmise that existing unimodal encoders pre-trained on large amounts of unimodal data should provide an effective bootstrap to create multimodal models from unimodal ones at much lower costs.

Evidence:
- We surmise that existing unimodal encoders pre-trained on large amounts of unimodal data should provide an effective bootstrap to create multimodal models from unimodal ones at much lower costs.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: The claim is based on the authors' surmise, not direct experimental evidence.
  Quote: We surmise that existing unimodal encoders pre-trained on large amounts of unimodal data should provide an effective bootstrap to create multimodal models from unimodal ones at much lower costs.

- We introduce FuseMix, a multimodal augmentation scheme that operates on the latent spaces of arbitrary pre-trained unimodal encoders.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: None
  Quote: We therefore propose FuseMix, a multimodal augmentation scheme that operates on the latent spaces of arbitrary pre-trained unimodal encoders.

  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: The claim is based on the authors' results, not a direct comparison with all state-of-the-art methods.
