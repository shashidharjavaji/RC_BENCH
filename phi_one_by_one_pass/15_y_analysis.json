This paper formalizes an automatic hallucination triggering method, termed as the hallucination attack, to elicit LLMs to respond with hallucinations in an adversarial way. The hallucination attack includes two modes: weak semantic and Out-of-Distribution (OoD) attacks. The attack is based on a gradient-based token replacing strategy. The paper demonstrates that hallucination attack can generate adversarial prompts that maintain semantic consistency or are completely nonsensical. The attack can achieve a high success rate in triggering hallucinations in LLMs and can be applied to different LLMs, including Vicuna-7B and LLaMA2-7B-chat. The paper also proposes a simple threshold defense for hallucination attacks. The findings suggest that hallucination could be a fundamental feature of LLMs beyond training data and can be used to explore the robustness of LLMs and design defense strategies.\n\n### Introduction\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, they are prone to hallucinations, which are fabrications of non-existent facts or inappropriate information. This paper investigates the phenomenon of hallucinations in LLMs and proposes a novel perspective that hallucinations may be another view of adversarial examples. The paper introduces an automatic hallucination triggering method, termed as the hallucination attack, which includes two modes: weak semantic and OoD attacks. The attack is based on a gradient-based token replacing strategy. The paper demonstrates that hallucination attack can generate adversarial prompts that maintain semantic consistency or are completely nonsensical. The attack can achieve a high success rate in triggering hallucinations in LLMs and can be applied to different LLMs, including Vicuna-7B and LLaMA2-7B-chat. The paper also proposes a simple threshold defense for hallucination attacks. The findings suggest that hallucination could be a fundamental feature of LLMs beyond training data and can be used to explore the robustness of LLMs and design defense strategies.\n\n### Hallucination Attack\n\nThe hallucination attack is an automatic method to elicit hallucinations in LLMs. It includes two modes: weak semantic and OoD attacks. The weak semantic attack aims to find some weak semantic prompts to trigger hallucination while maintaining the semantic consistency of the prompts. The OoD attack starts with a sequence initialized with random tokens and aims to find a non-sense OoD prompt to elicit the LLMs to respond with any pre-defined hallucinations. The attack is based on a gradient-based token replacing strategy, which aims to replace some \"trigger\" tokens by maximizing the likelihood of pre-defined behaviors.\n\n### Results\n\nThe paper demonstrates that hallucination attack can generate adversarial prompts that maintain semantic consistency or are completely nonsensical. The attack can achieve a high success rate in triggering hallucinations in LLMs. The paper shows that both Vicuna-7B and LLaMA2-7B-chat models failed to resist the hallucination attacks. The paper also proposes a simple threshold defense for hallucination attacks. The defense is based on the entropy of the first token prediction. The paper shows that the defense can effectively reduce the success rate of triggering hallucinations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe paper concludes that hallucination could be a fundamental feature of LLMs beyond training data. The hallucination attack can be used to explore the robustness of LLMs and design defense strategies. The paper suggests that future research should focus on understanding the fundamental attributes of LLMs and developing more effective defense strategies against hallucination attacks.\n\n### References\n\n[1] Yao, Jia-Yu, et al. \"LLM LIES: HALLUCINATIONS ARE NOT BUGS, BUT FEATURES AS ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.10403 (2023).\n\n### Appendix\n\nThe paper provides additional details on the hallucination attack, including the dataset, settings, and evaluation.

The evaluation is based on human feedback.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback and suggestions.\n\n### Conflict of Interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\n### Funding\n\nThe authors acknowledge the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62072051).\n\n### Data Availability\n\nThe code and data for the hallucination attack are available on GitHub (https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Hallucination-Attack).\n\n### Ethics Statement\n\nThe authors declare that the study was conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines and that all participants provided informed consent.\n\n### Reproducibility Statement\n\nThe authors provide the code and data for the hallucination attack to ensure the reproducibility of the study.\n\n### Related Work\n\nThe paper discusses related work on LLMs, adversarial examples, and hallucinations. The paper highlights the similarities between hallucinations and adversarial examples and proposes a novel perspective on hallucinations in LLMs.\n\n### Methodology\n\nThe paper introduces a novel methodology for hallucination attack, which includes two modes: weak semantic and OoD attacks. The paper also proposes a simple threshold defense for hallucination attacks.\n\n### Results\n\nThe paper demonstrates that hallucination attack can generate adversarial prompts that maintain semantic consistency or are completely nonsensical.
