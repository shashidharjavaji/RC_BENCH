  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4. Analysis
  Limitations: The paper does not provide specific examples or data on how widespread this issue is among MLLMs.
  Exact Quote: The fourth problem is object hallucination following instructions.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The experimental results from MME benchmarking reveal common problems in MLLMs, such as not following instructions, lack of perception, lack of reasoning, and object hallucination. These issues provide valuable guidance for the development and improvement of MLLMs.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is derived from a comprehensive evaluation involving multiple MLLMs and a variety of tasks. The systematic approach to identifying and categorizing problems adds credibility to the findings.
  Limitations: The limitations of the evidence may include the potential for overfitting to the specific tasks in the MME benchmark, and the possibility that other untested tasks may reveal additional problems not covered by the benchmark.
