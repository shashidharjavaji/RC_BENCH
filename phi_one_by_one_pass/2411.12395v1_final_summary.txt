Claim 2:
Statement: Disambiguation via adding context performs better for both LLMs compared to rephrasing questions with 'what'.
Location: Results and Discussion

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: TABLE I and TABLE II show that disambiguation via adding context performs better for both GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini compared to rephrasing questions with 'what'.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section V: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
  Limitations: The evidence is based on the performance metrics from the experiments, which may not cover all types of ambiguity or account for all possible variations in questions.
  Exact Quote: Question coherence refers to the semantic similarity between the ground truth disambiguated question and the ambiguous question when disambiguated via the LLM following one of the two methods; Naive Answer Overlap refers to the semantic similarity between LLM responses obtained via the disambiguating prompts vs. the naive prompt; and finally GT Answer Overlap refers to the semantic similarity between the LLM response and the ground truth answer. Ideally, we want higher values for this metric. Interestingly, we see that for both GPT 4o and 4o-mini, using simple disambiguating prompts improves performance over the naive setting, implying that simple prompt-based, training-free approaches may be useful in improving LLM performance for ambiguous queries. Out of the two simple disambiguating methods explored, we see that disambiguation via adding context performs better for both LLMs.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The evidence from TABLE I and TABLE II supports the claim that disambiguation via adding context outperforms rephrasing questions with 'what' for both GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini models.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is robust as it is based on empirical data from controlled experiments using a significant sample size of 1,000 ambiguous questions.
  Limitations: The study may not account for all types of ambiguity or variations in question complexity. The performance improvement is specific to the models and dataset used and may not generalize to other LLMs or datasets.

Claim 3:
Statement: Few-shot fine-tuning does not provide any improvement in LLM performance on ambiguous questions.
Location: Results and Discussion

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: To evaluate whether small scale fine-tuning helps in improving LLM performance on ambiguous questions, we perform few-shot fine-tuning on GPT 4o-mini. To adapt our model for handling ambiguous questions, we fine-tuned the model using OpenAI’s API. We randomly sampled 50 question-answer pairs from AmbigQA. Each ambiguous question was stored as the prompt for the LLM, with ground truth being stored as the expected response from the LLM. The file was formatted as shown below for the 50 questions.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
  Limitations: The study acknowledges that the fine-tuning approach may have underperformed due to catastrophic forgetting.

- Evidence Text: The GT Answer Overlap for the 4o-mini model is 0.643 while that for the fine-tuned 4o-mini model is 0.626. Therefore, we see that fine-tuning, at least at this small scale, does not provide any improvement in LLM performance on ambiguous questions.
  Strength: moderate

  Limitations: The study suggests that the fine-tuning approach may have underperformed due to catastrophic forgetting and acknowledges that the improvement may not be significant.

Claim 4:
Statement: Lowering the temperature for LLM generation does not significantly improve performance on ambiguous questions.
Location: Results and Discussion

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Lowering the temperature for LLM generation results in reducing the'stochasticity' of the generated text, whereby the variance is reduced and the generated text is more predictable over multiple runs.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
  Limitations: The difference is not that significant.
  Exact Quote: Lowering the temperature (0.2 instead of 1.0, in this case) seem to have minor improvements in some cases, but the difference is not that significant.

Claim 5:
Statement: Contextual enrichment can significantly enhance model disambiguation accuracy but often adds irrelevant context.
Location: Conclusion and Future Works

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Problem with naive contextual enrichment: The Figures 2 and 3 show why the average is not going up when an LLM is prompted to insert context into a question. Although adding context should skew the plot 2 to the right (ie: be more similar to the ground truth), but instead its skewed to the left since its being held back every time it adds the wrong context which is not a problem when we have simply rephrased the question.
  Strength: strong
  Location: Section V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
  Limitations: Adding context can sometimes introduce irrelevant information, leading to incorrect disambiguation.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The authors conclude that contextual enrichment can significantly enhance model disambiguation accuracy but often adds irrelevant context, which can hinder performance improvements.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence provided in Figures 2 and 3 is robust, as it clearly shows the impact of contextual enrichment on the model's performance. However, the evidence is limited to a specific dataset (AmbigQA) and may not generalize to other datasets or scenarios.
  Limitations: The main limitation of the evidence is that it is based on a single dataset (AmbigQA) and may not be applicable to other datasets or scenarios. Additionally, the authors do not explore alternative methods for contextual enrichment that could potentially address the issue of irrelevant context.
