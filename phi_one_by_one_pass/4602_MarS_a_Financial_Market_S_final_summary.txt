            "exact_quote": "The order model for financial markets shares similarities with the Language Model (LM) for text. Both models strive to predict the subsequent event, whether it be a token in a text corpus or a trade order in financial markets. Additionally, the datasets for both are typically extensive, facilitating the training of robust models. Furthermore, data in both domains can be generated autoregressively. Nevertheless, substantial differences also exist between the two fields. Each order in the financial market is associated with a complex set of market dynamics, including the Limit Order Book (LOB), transactions, and potentially market news in natural language. Consequently, each order may be influenced by a broader array of information beyond the order stream itself. It is therefore imperative to encode this rich information compactly while preserving the autoregressive generation paradigm. More specifically, the paper introduces a novel tokenization process for orders and Limit Order Book (LOB) information."
