  Exact Quote: Lastly, we perform a financial decision analysis by integrating three key sub-tasks. This integration aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of our systemâ€™s performance. We leverage GPT-4 to predict stock prices for the upcoming week with the information provided by three sub-tasks and provide investment recommendations. On the one hand, we utilize the same structure-generated content to generate final decision. On the other hand, our sub-task analysis reveal that vertical agent structure excels in risk analysis, while single agent structure performs better in fundamental and market sentiment tasks. Consequently, we select the optimal structure for each subtask, resulting in a 'ensemble structure.' First, we evaluate the error between the target price predicted by GPT-4 for the upcoming week and the actual price. The error is defined as the absolute difference between the predicted and actual price. Despite the smallest target price difference is observed in dual agent structures, the ensemble agent structure outperforms other structures in price prediction accuracy. Then, we focus on the core evaluation metric of for intelligent investment research: the accuracy of AI agents in making investment decisions, specifically determining whether to buy or not based on predicted stock price movements. In our experiment involving 30 stocks, the ensemble structure successfully predicted the movements of 20 stocks, achieving a prediction accuracy of 66.7%, whereas the full vertical agent structure only achieved 50%.

Conclusion:
  Author's Conclusion: The ensemble agent structure yields the highest accuracy in predicting stock prices, with an average difference to target price of 2.35%, compared to other structures.
  Conclusion Justified: Yes
  Robustness: The evidence is based on a comparison of the average difference to target price across different agent structures, which is a direct measure of prediction accuracy in stock price forecasting.
