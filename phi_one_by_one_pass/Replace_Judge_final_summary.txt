### Instructions:In this task, you are given a scientific paper and a corresponding claim. Your task is to determine if the claim is supported by the paper. You will be provided with excerpts from the paper that are relevant to the claim. The output should be in the form of a JSON object with two keys: 'claim_id' and'verdict'. The 'claim_id' corresponds to the claim's identifier and'verdict' is either 'Supported', 'Refuted', or 'Not Enough Information' based on the provided excerpts.

Claim: The study found that the use of a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL) is more cost-effective than using GPT-4 as a single judge.

Excerpt: "PoLL is over seven times less expensive."

Output:
