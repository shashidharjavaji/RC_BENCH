Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: There is a significant gap between textual and visual representations in MLLMs, indicating unsatisfactory cross-modal representation alignment.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: we first analyzed the representation distribution of textual and visual tokens in MLLM, revealing two important findings: 1) there is a significant gap between textual and visual representations, indicating unsatisfactory cross-modal representation alignment; 2) representations of texts that contain and do not contain hallucinations are entangled, making it challenging to distinguish them.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: significant modality gap remains between the textual and visual tokens despite visual projection
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: the study only analyzed Vicuna, a specific LLM, which may not generalize to all MLLMs
  Exact Quote: as shown in Figure 1, we have two primary findings:

- Evidence Text: representations of texts that contain and do not contain hallucinations are entangled
  Strength: strong
  Location: Introduction
  Limitations: the study only analyzed Vicuna, a specific LLM, which may not generalize to all MLLMs
  Exact Quote: representations of texts that contain and do not contain hallucinations are entangled, making it challenging to differentiate them.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: the evidence provided shows a significant gap between textual and visual representations, as well as entanglement of representations of texts with and without hallucinations
Key Limitations: the study only analyzed Vicuna, a specific LLM, which may not generalize to all MLLMs

Claim 2:
Type: methodology/result
Statement: Introducing hallucinative captions as hard negative examples in contrastive learning can effectively reduce hallucinations in MLLMs.
Location: Method
Exact Quote: we propose hallucination-augmented cross-modal contrastive learning (HACL), which enhances the alignment between visual and textual representations to alleviate hallucinations. Texts with hallucination are used as hard negative examples for image anchors, naturally pulling closer representations of non-hallucinating text and visual samples while pushing away representations of non-hallucinating and hallucinative text.
