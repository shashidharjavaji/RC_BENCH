Claim 1:
Type: methodology/result
Statement: Feed-forward layers in transformer-based language models operate as key-value memories, where each key correlates with textual patterns in the training examples, and each value induces a distribution over the output vocabulary.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: We show that feed-forward layers in transformer-based language models operate as key-value memories, where each key correlates with textual patterns in the training examples, and each value induces a distribution over the output vocabulary.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Experiments show that the learned patterns are human-interpretable, and that lower layers tend to capture shallow patterns, while upper layers learn more semantic ones.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Experiments
  Limitations: The experiments are limited to a single transformer-based language model (Baevski and Auli, 2019).
  Exact Quote: Our experiments show that the learned patterns are human-interpretable, and that lower layers tend to capture shallow patterns, while upper layers learn more semantic ones.

- Evidence Text: The values complement the keys’ input patterns by inducing output distributions that concentrate probability mass on tokens likely to appear immediately after each pattern, particularly in the upper layers.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Experiments
  Limitations: The experiments are limited to a single transformer-based language model (Baevski and Auli, 2019).
  Exact Quote: The values complement the keys’ input patterns by inducing output distributions that concentrate probability mass on tokens likely to appear immediately after each pattern, particularly in the upper layers.

- Evidence Text: The output of a feed-forward layer is a composition of its memories, which is subsequently refined throughout the model’s layers via residual connections to produce the final output distribution.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Experiments
  Limitations: The experiments are limited to a single transformer-based language model (Baevski and Auli, 2019).
  Exact Quote: We demonstrate that the output of a feed-forward layer is a composition of its memories, which is subsequently refined throughout the model’s layers via residual connections to produce the final output distribution.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence supports the claim that feed-forward layers operate as key-value memories, with keys correlating to textual patterns and values inducing output distributions. The experiments are limited to a single transformer-based language model, but the findings are consistent across multiple layers and patterns.
Key Limitations: The experiments are limited to a single transformer-based language model.
