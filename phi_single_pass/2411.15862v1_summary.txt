Claim 1:
Type: result
Statement: LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning.
Location: Introduction
Exact Quote: we find the model hardly calculates the intermediate results in implicit reasoning, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: accuracy of probing the result of each step in a 3-step or 5-step problem
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Approach/2.2
  Limitations: accuracy decreases with more steps
  Exact Quote: The results in Figure 2 and Figure 3 shows the accuracy of probing the intermediate result of each step when the problem is 3-step or 5-step.

- Evidence Text: model does memorize the input value and does conceive the final answer
  Strength: strong
  Location: Approach/2.2
  Limitations: not a specific state where the model calculates the results of the intermediate steps
  Exact Quote: The results in Figure 2 and Figure 3 shows the accuracy of probing the intermediate result of each step when the problem is 3-step or 5-step.

- Evidence Text: performance degrades significantly when using implicit reasoning with modified problems
  Strength: strong
  Location: Conclusion
  Limitations: performance is always perfect with explicit reasoning
  Exact Quote: The results in Table 1, we can clearly see that, compare to the original problems, the modified problems significantly degrade the performance when using implicit reasoning.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: high
Confidence Level: high
Justification: The evidence shows that LLMs do not calculate intermediate results in implicit reasoning, and their performance degrades with modified problems.
Key Limitations: accuracy decreases with more steps, performance is always perfect with explicit reasoning
