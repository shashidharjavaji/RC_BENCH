Claim 2:
Type: result
Statement: Responses in Yorùbá are more inaccurate than those in English.
Location: Section 3
Exact Quote: the results and analysis (Section 3) shows that responses in Yorùbá are more inaccurate than those in English.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: The dataset was split into equal size of documents in each length bucket. We can see a drop in performance when the Yorùbá documents reach 1,500 words.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: The performance drop may be due to the shorter length of Yorùbá documents, which makes the task easier.
  Exact Quote: The dataset was split into equal size of documents in each length bucket. We can see a drop in performance when the Yorùbá documents reach 1,500 words.

- Evidence Text: English performance demonstrates a significant edge (1.58X-2.56X) for a small portion of long-enough documents of comparable length between English and Yorùbá.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: The comparison is limited to a small subset of documents.
  Exact Quote: English performance demonstrates a significant edge (1.58X-2.56X) for a small portion of long-enough documents of comparable length between English and Yorùbá.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is supported by the performance analysis, but the limitations of the comparison must be considered.
Key Limitations: The comparison is limited to a small subset of documents.

Claim 3:
Type: result
Statement: The reading comprehension capabilities of current English LLMs do not extend to Yorùbá.
Location: Section 4
Exact Quote: our experiments show that the reading comprehension capabilities of current English LLMs do not extend to Yorùbá.

Evidence:
- Evidence Text: Y-NQ is not exactly comparable in its totality between languages.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: The dataset is not fully comparable between English and Yorùbá, since documents and answers vary in length.
  Exact Quote: Y-NQ is not exactly comparable in its totality between English and Yorùbá.

- Evidence Text: The task is easier for Yorùbá due to shorter documents.
  Strength: moderate
  Location: Section 4
  Limitations: The task difficulty is influenced by document length, which may not reflect the true capabilities of LLMs.
  Exact Quote: The fact that Yorùbá has shorter documents than English, the reading comprehension task is easier for Yorùbá.

Evaluation:
Conclusion Justified: Yes
Robustness: medium
Confidence Level: medium
Justification: The claim is supported by the performance analysis, but the limitations of the comparison must be considered.
Key Limitations: The comparison is limited to a small subset of documents and influenced by document length.
