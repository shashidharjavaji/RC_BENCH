An MED can operate either as a unimodal encoder, or an image-grounded text encoder, or an image-grounded text decoder. The model is jointly pre-trained with three vision-language objectives: imagetext contrastive learning, image-text matching, and imageconditioned language modeling. (b) Captioning and Filtering (CapFilt): a new dataset boostrapping method for learning from noisy image-text pairs. We finetune a pre-trained MED into two modules: a captioner to produce synthetic captions given web images, and a filter to remove noisy captions."
